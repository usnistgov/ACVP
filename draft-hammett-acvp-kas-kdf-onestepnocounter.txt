3.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing KDA-
   OneStepNoCounter SP800-56C implementations using ACVP.

   This document is a work-product of the NIST (https://www.nist.gov/)
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
   (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-
   program) (CAVP).  Please communicate questions and feedback
   concerning this document to the CAVP by opening an issue on the
   usnistgov/ACVP GitHub repository at

5.  Supported KDA OneStepNoCounter

   The following key derivation algorithms MAY be advertised by the ACVP
   compliant cryptographic module:

   *  KDA / OneStepNoCounter / SP800-56Cr2

6.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the KDAs specific to the
   KAS protocol in order to assess the correctness and robustness of the
   implementation.  A typical ACVP validation session SHALL require
   multiple tests to be performed for every supported permutation of KDA
   capabilities.  This section describes the design of the tests used to
   validate implementations of KDA algorithms.

6.1.  Test Types

   There are two test types for KDA testing:

   *  "AFT" - Algorithm Function Test.  In the AFT test mode, the IUT
      SHALL act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server.
      The server SHALL generate and provide all necessary information
      for the IUT to perform a successful key agreement; both the server
      and IUT MAY act as party U/V.

Internet-Draft        ACVP KAS KDF OneStepNoCounter        December 2025


   *  "VAL" - Validation Test.  In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server
      MUST generate a complete (from both party U and party V's
      perspectives) key agreement, and expects the IUT to be able to
      determine if that agreement is valid.  Various types of errors
      MUST be introduced in varying portions of the key agreement
      process that the IUT MUST be able to detect and report on.

6.2.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [SP800-56Cr2].

6.2.1.  Requirements Covered

   *  SP 800-56C - 4 One-Step Key Derivation.  All functionality
      described in the specification is covered by ACVP testing.

6.2.2.  Requirements Not Covered

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 / SP 800-56Br2 - ASN.1 encoding for the KDA is not
      currently supported.

7.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of KDA-OneStepNoCounter
   SP800-56C algorithms to the ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within
   the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification [ACVP] for more
   details on the registration message.

7.1.  Prerequisites

   Each algorithm implementation MAY rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, RSA Signature algorithms depend on an
   underlying hash function.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

Internet-Draft        ACVP KAS KDF OneStepNoCounter        December 2025


   Prerequisites, if applicable, MUST be submitted in the registration
   as the prereqVals JSON property array inside each element of the
   algorithms array.  Each element in the prereqVals array MUST contain
   the following properties

        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | JSON Property | Description                 | JSON Type |
        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | algorithm     | a prerequisite algorithm    | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | valValue      | algorithm validation number | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+

                      Table 1: Prerequisite Properties

   A "valValue" of "same" SHALL be used to indicate that the
   prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability
   exchange in the same registration.

   An example description of prerequisites within a single algorithm
   capability exchange looks like this

   "prereqVals":
   [
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg1",
       "valValue": "Val-1234"
     },
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg2",
       "valValue": "same"
     }
   ]

7.2.  Property Registration

   The KDA-OneStepNoCounter SP800-56C mode capabilities are advertised
   as JSON objects within a root "algorithm" object.  The
   OneStepNoCounter differs from the OneStep KDA only so far as the "l"
   property is specified on a per auxiliary function basis, there is no
   counter or loop within the KDA implementation itself, and as such is
   limited to producing DKM at a maximum length of the output length of
   the auxiliary function.

   A registration SHALL use these properties:

7.2.1.  Prerequisite Algorithms for KDA Validations

   Some algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, IKEv2 uses an underlying SHA algorithm.
   Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated,
   either separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

8.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation test session would require multiple test
   vector sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each
   test vector set represents an individual cryptographic algorithm
   defined during the capability exchange.  This section describes the
   JSON schema for a test vector set used with KDA-OneStepNoCounter
   SP800-56C algorithms.

Internet-Draft        ACVP KAS KDF OneStepNoCounter        December 2025


   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

    +=============+======================================+===========+
    | JSON Values | Description                          | JSON Type |

8.1.  Test Groups JSON Schema

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the KDA-OneStepNoCounter SP800-56C JSON
   elements of the Test Group JSON object

9.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it MUST
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | JSON Property | Description                 | JSON Type |
        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | acvVersion    | The version of the protocol | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | vsId          | The vector set identifier   | integer   |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | testGroups    | The test group data         | array     |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+

                  Table 11: Vector Set Response Properties

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

                  Table 12: Test Group Response Properties

   The testCase section is used to organize the ACVP client response in
   a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

   The following table describes the JSON object that represents a test
   case response for a KDA-OneStepNoCounter SP800-56C.

    +============+=========================================+=========+
    | JSON       | Description                             | JSON    |
