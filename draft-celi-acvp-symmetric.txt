2.  Abstract

   This document defines the JSON schema for testing Symmetric Block
   Cipher implementations with the ACVP specification.

3.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing Symmetric
   Block Cipher implementations using ACVP.

   This document is a work-product of the NIST (https://www.nist.gov/)
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
   (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-
   program) (CAVP).  Please communicate questions and feedback
   concerning this document to the CAVP by opening an issue on the
   usnistgov/ACVP GitHub repository at
   https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP/issues.

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the block ciphers in order
   to assess the correctness and robustness of the implementation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple tests to be
   performed for every supported cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-
   ECB, AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM, TDES-CBC, TDES-CTR, etc.

   *  ACVP-TDES-CFBP64 / "1.0"

   *  ACVP-TDES-OFB / "1.0"

   *  ACVP-TDES-OFBI / "1.0"

   *  ACVP-TDES-CTR / "1.0"

   *  ACVP-TDES-KW / "1.0"

   Multiple testing revisions of the same algorithm allow a validation
   server to improve testing over time without breaking functionality of
   existing clients.  In the case of symmetric block cipher algorithms,
   multiple revisions of ACVP-AES-XTS exist and MAY individually be
   provided by a server.  The revision numbers of "1.0" and "2.0"
   indicate a progression among the tests.  In this case, the "2.0"
   tests are fully capable of running the "1.0" implementation of ACVP-
   AES-XTS.  More discussion can be found within Section 7.3.

5.1.  Supported Conformances

   The following conformances MAY be advertised by the ACVP compliant
   cryptographic module:

   *  ACVP-AES-CCM conformance "ECMA" which expands upon AES-CCM and
      adheres to [ECMA].  This conformance changes the supported sizes
      to accomodate the specific sizes required by the use-case of the
      algorithm.

   *  ACVP-AES-CTR conformance "RFC3686".  This conformance ensures the
      IV is generated with the LSB[32] of the IV representing the
      integer "1".  This conformance also requires the additional
      registration property of "ivGenMode" which states if the IUT does
      external or internal IV generation.

6.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of block cipher algorithms.

6.1.  Test Types

   There are three types of tests for block ciphers: functional tests,
   Monte Carlo tests and counter tests.  Each has a specific value to be
   used in the testType field.  The testType field definitions are:

Internet-Draft        ACVP Symmetric Block Ciphers         December 2025


   *  "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  These tests can be processed
      by the client using a normal 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' operation.
      AFTs cause the implementation under test to exercise normal
      operations on a single block, multiple blocks, or (where
      applicable) partial blocks.  In some cases random data is used, in
      others, static, predetermined tests are provided.  The functional
      tests of the block cipher are designed to verify that the logical
      components of the cipher (GFSbox, KeySbox, block chaining etc.)
      are operating correctly.

   *  "MCT" - Monte Carlo Test.  These tests exercise the implementation
      under test under strenuous circumstances.  The implementation
      under test must process the test vectors according to the correct
      algorithm and mode in this document.  MCTs can help detect
      potential memory leaks over time, and problems in allocation of
      resources, addressing variables, error handling and generally
      improper behavior in response to random inputs.  Not every
      algorithm and mode combination has an MCT.  See Section 6.1.1 for
      implementation details.

   *  "CTR" - Counter Mode Test.  Counter tests are specifically for
      counter modes (AES-CTR and TDES-CTR) and require an implementation
      under test to exercise their counter mechanism.  The server will
      send a long message to the client for encryption or decryption and
      back-compute the IVs used by the implementation under test.  These
      IVs are then verified for uniqueness and an increasing (or
      decreasing) nature.  The client processes these tests as normal
      AFTs.  The different mode is highlighted here to signify the
      difference on the server side for processing.

6.1.1.  Monte Carlo tests for block ciphers

   The MCTs start with an initial condition (plaintext/ciphertext, key,
   and optional, or maybe multiple IVs) and perform a series of chained
   computations.  For modes that use an IV, the IV is used in the
   beginning of each pseudorandom process.  The IV is implicitly
   advanced according to the block cipher mode in use.  There are
   separate rounds of MCT for encryption and decryption.  Because some
   block cipher modes rely on an IV and perform calculations differently
   from other modes, there are specific definitions of MCT for many of
   the block cipher modes.

6.1.1.1.  AES Monte Carlo Test - ECB mode

6.1.1.1.1.  Encrypt

   The initial condition for the test is the tuple (KEY, PT) set to some
   values.

6.1.1.7.  AES Monte Carlo Key Shuffle

   Most AES MCTs use a shared key shuffle routine.  The algorithm is
   shown in Section 6.1.1.7.

   The initial condition for the routine is a tuple (KEY, CT) set to
   some values.  This pseudocode is specifically for encryption.  For
   decryption, swap all instances of CT with PT.  The || symbol is used
   to denote concatenation.  The MSB (most significant bits) and LSB
   (least significant bits) functions accept a bit string and an integer
   amount of bits to capture.  For example MSB(A, 8) would capture the 8
   most significant bits of the bit string A.

   If ( keylen = 128 )
       Key[i+1] = Key[i] xor MSB(CT[j], 128)
   If ( keylen = 192 )
       Key[i+1] = Key[i] xor (LSB(CT[j-1], 64) || MSB(CT[j], 128))
   If ( keylen = 256 )
       Key[i+1] = Key[i] xor (MSB(CT[j-1], 128) || MSB(CT[j], 128))

6.2.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [FIPS-197] and [SP800-38A].

6.2.1.  AES Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-38A], both Section 5 and Section 6 which describe general
   modes of operation for block ciphers are tested.  In [FIPS-197],
   Section 4 outlines the AES engine and necessary functions to perform
   simple encrypt an decrypt operations.  All AES tests perform such
   operations and thus rely heavily on this section.  Section 5
   specifically outlines the algorithm for AES and thus all AES tests
   rely heavily on this section as well.  All of [SP800-38A-Add]
   requirements are covered.  In [AES-XTS], the IEEE outlines the

   encrypt and decrypt operations for AES-XTS.

6.2.2.  AES Requirements Not Covered

   Some requirements in the outlined specifications are not easily
   tested.  Often they are not ideal for black-box testing such as the
   ACVP.  In [SP800-38A], Appendix A outlines padding for when the data
   being encrypted does not evenly fill the blocks.  In these tests, all
   data, unless otherwise specified, is assumed to be a multiple of the
   block length.  All exceptions to those cases are when stream ciphers
   specifically are being tested.  In Section 5.3, IV generation which
   is required for all modes of AES and TDES outside of ECB, is not
   tested.  Appendix D outlines how errors are to be handled.  As some
   symmetric ciphers aren't authenticated, ACVP does not include tests
   that change random bits in payload, IV, key or results, as these
   results can be successfully encrypted/decrypted, but errors aren't
   necessarily detectable.

   In [FIPS-197], Section 5.3 defines the inverse cipher for AES.  This
   is not tested in the CBC, CFB (all), OFB or CTR modes.

   In [SP800-38E], the AES-XTS algorithm is restricted to 2\^20 AES
   blocks (128-bits each) per key.  Due to the size of the data, ACVP
   does not test the proper usage of a key over such large amounts of
   data.

   In the [RFC3686] testing conformance of AES-CTR, tests will be
   generated ensuring the LSB[32] of the IV represents the integer value
   of "1".  These tests will allow for either internal or external IV
   generation from the perspective of the IUT.

6.2.3.  AES Format Preserving Encryption Requirements Covered

   All of [SP800-38Gr1] requirements are covered.

6.2.4.  AES Format Preserving Encryption Requirements Not Covered

   N/A

6.2.5.  TDES Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-67r2], Section 3 outlines the use for TDES with keying
   option 1 (three distinct keys) and decryption only for keying option
   2 (K1 == K3 != K2).  Depending on the cipher mode, both the forward
   and inverse cipher are tested.  The known answer tests address these
   requirements.

Internet-Draft        ACVP Symmetric Block Ciphers         December 2025


6.2.6.  TDES Requirements Not Covered

   In [SP800-67r2], Section 3.3 outlines requirements for keys for
   proper usage of TDES.  These requirements are not tested by ACVP.
   All keys used in the tests are randomly or staticly generated by the
   server.  There are no checks for key equality or potentially weak
   keys.  Section 3.3.2 outlines specific keys which are to be avoided.
   ACVP does not expect a client to be able to detect these keys.

6.2.7.  AEAD Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-38D], Section 7 outlines the encrypt and decrypt operations
   for AES-GCM.  This and all prerequisites to these operations (such as
   GHASH) are tested as AES-GCM encrypt and decrypt operations.

   In [SP800-38C], Section 6 outlines the encrypt and decrypt operations
   for AES-CCM.  This and all prerequisites to these operations (such as
   CBC-MAC) are tested as AES-CCM encrypt and decrypt operations.  In
   [AES-GCM-SIV], the draft outlines the encrypt and decrypt operations
   for AES-GCM-SIV.

6.2.8.  AEAD Requirements Not Covered

   In [SP800-38D], Section 8 outlines uniqueness requirements on IVs and
   keys for AES-GCM.  This is considered out of bounds for the algorithm
   testing done by the ACVP and will not be tested.

6.2.9.  KeyWrap Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-38F] Section 5.2 defines the authenticated encryption and
   authenticated decryption operations for all three key-wrap
   algorithms.  As well, the padding for key-wrap with padding is
   defined.  Algorithm Functional Tests provide assurance of these
   requirements for encrypt operations.  For decrypt operations, there
   is a possibility to reject the ciphertext due to improper wrapping.
   This is also assured by the Algorithm Functional Tests.

   Sections 6 and 7 outline the specific ciphers in both encrypt and
   decrypt directions.  All facsets of these processes are tested with
   random data via the Algorithm Functional Tests.

Internet-Draft        ACVP Symmetric Block Ciphers         December 2025


6.2.10.  KeyWrap Requirements Not Covered

   In [SP800-38F] Section 5.3 defines the length requirements allowed by
   an optimal implementation.  The upper bounds are unreasonably large
   to test in a web-based model and thus an artificial maximum is
   selected for the payloadLen property (corresponding to both plaintext
   and ciphertext).  The Algorithm Functional Tests SHOULD utilize both
   the minimum and maximum values provided in the client's registration
   optimally with other values.

7.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of Block Cipher algorithms to
   the ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within
   the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification [ACVP] for more
   details on the registration message.

7.1.  Prerequisites

   Each algorithm implementation MAY rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, RSA Signature algorithms depend on an
   underlying hash function.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

   Prerequisites, if applicable, MUST be submitted in the registration
   as the prereqVals JSON property array inside each element of the
   algorithms array.  Each element in the prereqVals array MUST contain
   the following properties

   A "valValue" of "same" SHALL be used to indicate that the
   prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability
   exchange in the same registration.

   An example description of prerequisites within a single algorithm
   capability exchange looks like this

   "prereqVals":

     {
       "algorithm": "Alg1",
       "valValue": "Val-1234"

       "valValue": "same"
     }
   ]

7.2.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for Block Cipher Validations

   Some block cipher algorithm implementations rely on other
   cryptographic primitives.  For example, AES-CCM uses an underlying
   AES-ECB algorithm.  Each of these underlying algorithm primitives
   MUST be validated, either separately or as part of the same
   submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required
   prerequisites:

          Table 3: Block Cipher Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

      |  NOTE 1: The 'conformances' property is only valid for
      |  algorithms listed in Section 5.1.  The valid values in the
      |  array are also listed in that section.  The array is always
      |  optional.

      |  NOTE 2: Some optional values are required depending on the
      |  algorithm.  For example, AES-GCM requires ivLen, ivGen, aadLen,
      |  and tagLen.  Failure to provide these values will result in the
      |  ACVP server returning an error to the ACVP client during
      |  registration.

      |  NOTE 3: The 'performCounterTests' option is provided for
      |  counter implementations such as linear-feedback shift registers
      |  which may not present an always increasing or decreasing
      |  counter while still ensuring the IV is unique.  This value
      |  defaults to true if not present.  If it is set to false, the
      |  'overflowCounter' and 'incrementalCounter' values will not be
      |  used.

   The following grid outlines which properties are REQUIRED, as well as
   all the possible values a server MAY support for each standard block
   cipher algorithm:

      |  NOTE: The difference in testing between ACVP-AES-XTS / "1.0"
      |  and ACVP-AES-XTS / "2.0" is the inclusion of the data unit in
      |  the "2.0" revision.  The [AES-XTS] standard provides the
      |  concept of a data unit as a means of logically breaking apart a
      |  data stream provided to the encryption algorithm.  A data unit
      |  may be larger, smaller or equal to the payload being processed.
      |  In the case of the "1.0" revision, the data unit length always
      |  matches the payload length.  Thus, the equivalent of the "1.0"
      |  revision can be accessed via the "2.0" revision by setting the
      |  'dataUnitLenMatchesPayload' field to true.  Within the prompt,
      |  in "1.0", the test group contains the payload length for the
      |  entire group.  In "2.0" this is moved to the test case level
      |  and handled on a per case basis along with the data unit
      |  length.  Both values may be provided in the test case JSON even
      |  when 'dataUnitLenMatchesPayload' is true.

8.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation test session would require multiple test
   vector sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each
   test vector set represents an individual cryptographic algorithm
   defined during the capability exchange.  This section describes the
   JSON schema for a test vector set used with Symmetric Block Cipher
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

       "revision": "Revision1.0",
       "testGroups": [ ... ]
     }
   ]

8.1.  Test Groups

   Test vector sets MUST contain one or more test groups, each sharing
   similar properties.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same
   key size would be grouped together.  The testGroups element at the
   top level of the test vector JSON object SHALL be the array of test
   groups.  The Test Group JSON object MUST contain meta-data that
   applies to all test cases within the group.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements that MAY appear from the server in the
   Test Group JSON object:

9.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it SHALL
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server within the alloted
   timeframe.  The following table describes the JSON object that
   represents a vector set response.

                Table 19: Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroup Response section is used to organize the ACVP client
   response in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several
   algorithms SHALL require the client to send back group level
   properties in its response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

              Table 20: Vector Set Group Response JSON Object

   Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single test object
   to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes
   the JSON elements for each test case object.

Appendix B.  Example Vector Set Request/Responses JSON Object

   The following sections provide examples of the JSON objects for each
   of the AES algorithms.  Examples will reflect what testTypes are
   supported by each algorithm, ie AFT, MCT or counter.  MCT examples
   have only 2 iterations shown for brevity.

   The following shows AES-GCM AFT request vectors.

   The following is a example JSON object for test results sent from the
   crypto module to the ACVP server for an TDES-ECB Monte Carlo test,
   only 2 iterations shown for brevity.  For MCT results of each
   iteration are fed into the next iteration.  Therefore the results
   carry all fields to assist in any failure diagnosis.
