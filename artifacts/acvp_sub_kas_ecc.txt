1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing KAS ECC
   algorithms using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the KAS protocol in order
   to assess the correctness and robustness of the implementation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session SHALL require multiple tests to be
   performed for every supported permutation of KAS capabilities.  This
   section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of KAS algorithms.  There are two test types for KAS
   testing:

      "AFT" - Algorithm Function Test.  In the AFT test mode, the IUT
      SHALL act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server.
      The server SHALL generate and provide all necessary information
      for the IUT to perform a successful key agreement; both the server
      and IUT MAY act as party U/V, as well as recipient/provider to key
      confirmation.

      "VAL" - Validation test.  In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server
      MUST generate a complete (from both party U and party V's

      perspectives) key agreement, and expects the IUT to be able to
      determine if that agreement is valid.  Various types of errors
      MSUT be introduced in varying portions of the key agreement
      process (changed DKM, changed key, changed hash digest, etc), that
      the IUT MUST be able to detect and report on.

2.1.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [SP800-56a].

2.1.1.  KAS-ECC Requirements Covered

      SP 800-56a - 4.1 Key Establishment Preparations.  The ACVP server
      is responsible for generating domain parameters as per the IUT's
      capability registration.

      SP 800-56a - 4.2 Key-Agreement Process.  Both the ACVP server and
      IUT participate in the Key Agreement process.  The server and IUT
      can both take the roles of party U/V, and as such the "performer"
      of steps depicted in "Figure 2: Key Agreement process" can vary.

      SP 800-56a - 5.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions.  All modes of
      performing KAS SHALL make use of a hash function.  The hash
      function MAY be used for confirmation of a successfully generated
      shared secret Z (noKdfNoKc), or as a primitive within the KDF
      being tested (kdfNoKc and kdfKc).

      SP 800-56a - 5.2 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithm.  A
      MAC is utilized for confirmation of success for kdfNoKc and kdfKc
      modes of KAS.  Note - a MAC prerequisite is REQUIRED only for
      kdfKc, though is utilized for both kdfNoKc and kdfKc.

      SP 800-56a - 5.4 Nonce.  Nonces are made use of in various KAS
      schemes - both the ACVP server and IUT SHALL be expected to
      generate nonces.

      SP 800-56a - 5.6 Domain Parameters.  Domain Parameter Generation
      SHALL be performed solely from the ACVP server, with constraints
      from the IUTs capabilities registration.  The same set of domain
      parameters SHALL generate all keypairs (party U/V, static/
      ephemeral) for a single test case.

      SP 800-56a - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation.  While Key-Pairs are used in
      each KAS scheme, the generation of said key-pairs is out of scope
      for KAS testing.  Random tests from the VAL groups, MAY inject bad
      keypairs that the IUT MUST be able detect.  These random tests are

      only present in groups given appropriate assurance functions see:
      Section 3.3

      SP 800-56a - 4.3 DLC-based Key-Transport Process / 5.7 DLC
      Primitives.  Depending on the scheme used, either Diffie Hellman
      or MQV SHALL be used to negotiate a shared secret of z.  Testing
      and validation of such key exchanges is covered under their
      respective schemes.

      SP 800-56a - 5.8 Key-Derivation Methods for Key-Agreement Schemes.
      All schemes/modes save noKdfNoKc (component) MUST make use of a
      KDF.  KDF construction SHALL utilize Section 3.10.1 for its
      pattern.

      SP 800-56a - 5.9 Key Confirmation.  Most KAS schemes allow for a
      Key Confirmation process, the ACVP server and IUT MAY be Providers
      or Recipients of said confirmation.  Additionally, key
      confirmation MAY be performed on one or both parties (depending on
      scheme).

      SP 800-56a - 6 Key Agreement Schemes.  All schemes specified in
      referenced document are supported for validation with the ACVP
      server.

2.1.2.  KAS-ECC Requirements Not Covered

      SP 800-56a - 4.1 Key Establishment Preparations.  The ACVP server
      SHALL NOT make a distinction between IUT generated keys via a
      trusted third party and the IUT itself.

      SP 800-56a - 5.3 Random Number Generation.  The IUT MUST perform
      all random number generation with a validated random number
      generator.  A DRBG is REQUIRED as a prerequisite to KAS, but SHALL
      NOT be in the scope testing assurances.

      SP 800-56a - 5.4 Nonce.  Nonce generation is utilized for several
      schemes.  The various methods of generating a nonce described in
      section 5.5 MUST be used, however their generation SHALL NOT be in
      scope of KAS testing assurances

      SP 800-56a - 5.5.2 Assurances of Domain-Parameter Validity.  The
      ACVP server SHALL generate all domain parameters, IUT validation
      of such parameters is SHALL NOT be in scope for KAS testing.

      SP 800-56a - 5.5.3 Domain Parameter Management.  Domain Parameter
      Management SHALL NOT be in scope for KAS testing.

      SP 800-56a - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation.  While Key-Pairs MUST be
      used in each KAS scheme, the generation, assurances, and
      management of said key-pairs SHALL NOT be in scope of KAS testing.

      SP 800-56a - 5.8 Key-Derivation Methods for Key-Agreement Schemes.
      Two-step Key-Derivation (Extraction-then-Expansion) SHALL NOT be
      utilized in KAS testing.

      SP 800-56a - 5.9 Key Confirmation.  KMAC is referenced in 800-56a
      as being a valid MAC function; it however SHALL NOT (currently) be
      supported in KAS testing.

      SP 800-56a - 5.7 Rationale for Selecting a Specific Scheme.  It is
      expected that the IUT registers all schemes it supports in its
      capabilities registration.  Selecting specific schemes from a KAS
      testing perspective SHALL NOT be in scope.

      SP 800-56a - 8 Key Recovery.  Key Recovery SHALL NOT be in scope
      of KAS testing.

3.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP REQUIRES crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of KAS ECC algorithms to the
   ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each KDF algorithm capability advertised is a
   self-contained JSON object.

3.1.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for KAS ECC Validations

   Some algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, IKEv2 uses an underlying SHA algorithm.
   Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated,
   either separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

                   Table 12: KAS ECC KDF Option Details

3.10.1.  Other Information Construction

   Some IUTs MAY require a specific pattern for the OtherInfo portion of
   the KDFs for KAS.  An "oiPattern" is specified in the KDF
   registration to accommodate such requirements.  Regardless of the
   oiPattern specified, the OI bitlength MUST be 240 for FFC, and 376
   for ECC.  The OI SHALL be padded with random bits (or the most
   significant bits utilized) when the specified OI pattern does not
   meet the bitlength requirement

   Pattern candidates:

   o  literal[0123456789ABCDEF]

      *  uses the specified hex within "[]". literal[0123456789ABCDEF]
         substitutes "0123456789ABCDEF" in place of the field

   o  uPartyInfo

      *  uPartyId { || dkmNonce }

         +  dkmNonce is provided by party u for static schemes

   o  vPartyInfo

      *  vPartyId

   o  counter

      *  32bit counter starting at "1" (0x00000001)

   Example (Note that party U is the server in this case "434156536964",
   party V is the IUT "a1b2c3d4e5", using an ECC non-static scheme):

   o  "concatenation" :
      "literal[123456789CAFECAFE]||uPartyInfo||vPartyInfo"

              Table 14: Required Party Generation Obligations

5.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual KAS ECC function.  This section
   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with KAS ECC
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

5.1.  Test Groups JSON Schema

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the secure hash JSON elements of the Test
   Group JSON object.

   The test group for KAS ECC is as follows:

   +----------------+----------------------+----------------+----------+
   | JSON Value     | Description          | JSON type      | Optional |
   +----------------+----------------------+----------------+----------+

6.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it must
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

   +------------+---------------------------------------------+--------+
   | JSON Value | Description                                 | JSON   |
   |            |                                             | type   |
   +------------+---------------------------------------------+--------+
   | acvVersion | Protocol version identifier                 | value  |
   |            |                                             |        |
   | vsId       | Unique numeric identifier for the vector    | value  |
   |            | set                                         |        |
   |            |                                             |        |
   | testGroups | Array of JSON objects that represent each   | array  |
   |            | test vector group. See Table 19             |        |
   +------------+---------------------------------------------+--------+

                 Table 18: Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

   +-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
   | JSON      | Description                                | JSON     |
   | Value     |                                            | type     |
   +-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
   | tgId      | The test group Id                          | value    |
   |           |                                            |          |
   | tests     | The tests associated to the group          | value    |
   |           | specified in tgId                          |          |
   |           |                                            |          |
   +-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+

          Table 24: CDH Component Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

       Table 25: CDH Component Vector Set Group Response JSON Object

   Each test group contains an array of one or more test cases.  Each
   test case is a JSON object that represents a single test vector to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each DRBG test vector.
