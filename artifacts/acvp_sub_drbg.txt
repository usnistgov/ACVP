1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing NIST-
   approved DRBG algorithms from SP 800-90A [SP800-90A] using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Default values

   ACVP has default values for many of the input parameters for testing
   the DRBG algorithms.For example, the Entropy Input, Nonce,
   Personalization String, and Addtional Input parameters have default

   values.  The specific details and restrictions on each of these input
   lengths is specified in Section 2, Table 3 and the notes following
   it.  To indicate a preference for using a default value for any of
   these parameters, the value zero (0) should be set.  If the
   implementation does not support one of these defaults, the
   corresponding supported bit length values shall be set explicitly.

2.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of DRBG algorithms to the ACVP
   server.

2.1.  Supported DRBG Algorithms

   The following DRBG algorithms and modes may be advertised by the ACVP
   compliant crypto module:

2.2.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for DRBG Validations

   Each DRBG implementation relies on other cryptographic primitives
   (algorithms) - see [SP800-90A].  For example, a hashDRBG uses an
   underlying hash algorithm.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

2.3.  Supported DRBG Algorithm Capabilities

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each DRBG algorithm capability advertised is a
   self-contained JSON object.  The following JSON values are used for
   DRBG algorithm capabilities:

   Note 2: Implementations that either have prediction resistance always

   Note 3: Implementations that can be used either way will have both
   flags set.

   Note 4: For ctrDRBG implementations, at least one of the derivation
   function options shall be set depending on the one actually used or
   both

   Note 5: All DRBGs are tested at their maximum supported security
   strength so this is the minimum bit length of the entropy input that
   ACVP will accept.  The maximum supported security strength is also
   the default value for this input.  Longer entropy inputs are
   permitted, with the following exception: for ctrDRBG with no df, the
   bit length must equal the seed length.

   Note 6: ctrDRBG with no derivation function (ctrDRBGWithoutDerFunc)
   does not use a nonce; the nonce values, if supplied, will be ignored
   for this case.  The default nonce bit length is one-half the maximum
   security strength supported by the mechanism/option.

   Note 7: ACVP allows bit length values for persoString ranging from
   the maximum supported security strength except in the case of
   ctrDRBGWithoutDerFunc, where the second personalization string length
   must be less than or equal to the seed length.  If the implementation
   only supports one personalization string length, then set only that
   value as the range min and max and set the step to zero (0)..  If the
   implementation does not use at all a persoString, set all range
   parameters (min, max, step) to 0 (zero).  If the implementation can
   work with and without persoString, set the min to zero (0), set the
   max to at least the maximum supported strength and set the step equal
   to at least the maximum supported strength to avoid testing lengths
   less than that.

   Note 8: The addtionalInput configuration and restrictions are the
   same as those for the persoString.

3.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual algorithm, such as Hash_DRBG,
   etc.  This section describes the JSON schema for a test vector set
   used with DRBG algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

                      Table 4: Vector Set JSON Object

3.1.  Test Groups JSON Schema

   The test_groups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the DRBG JSON elements of the Test Group
   JSON object.

   ACVP allows default bit lengths for the inputs to specific
   algorithms, typically communicated as numerical value zero (0).  If
   an implementation does not support one of the defaults, the bit
   lengths the supported values shall be specified explicitly.

   Note 9: According to SP 800-90A [SP800-90A], a DRBG implementation
   has two separate controls for determining the correct test procedure
   for handling addtional entropy and other data in providing prediction
   resistance assurances.  Depending on the capabilities advertised by
   the predResistanceEnabled and reseedImplemented flags ACVP generates
   test data according to the following test scenarios:
