1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing symmetric
   crypto algorithms using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of symmetric algorithms to the
   ACVP server.

   The symmetric algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects
   within the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each symmetric algorithm capability advertised
   is a self-contained JSON object.

2.1.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for Symmetric Validations

   Some symmetric algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, CCM uses an underlying AES algorithm.  Each
   of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated, either
   separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

3.  Algorithm Tests

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the block ciphers in order
   to assess the correctness and robustness of the implementation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple tests to be
   performed for every supported cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-
   ECB, AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM, DES-CBC, DES-CTR, etc.  This section
   describes the design of the tests used to validate implementations of
   symmetric block cipher algorithms.

   There are two types of tests for block ciphers: functional tests and
   Monte Carlo tests.

3.1.  Functional block cipher tests

   The functional tests of the block cipher are designed to verify that
   the logical components of the cipher (GFSbox, KeySbox, etc.) are
   operating correctly.  This test includes the verification that the
   implementation is designed to process multi-block messages, which may
   require chaining of information from one block to the next.

3.2.  Monte Carlo tests for block ciphers

   The Monte Carlo tests (MCT) are designed to provide much better test
   coverage of the implementation compared to the coverage resulting
   from testing with the controlled inputs of the functional tests in
   Section Section 3.1.  The goal of this test is to detect potential
   flaws in the implementation related to allocation of resources,
   addressing variables, error handling and generally improper behavior
   in response to random inputs.  Each MCT processes 100 pseudorandom
   tests.

Internet-Draft                Sym Alg JSON                   August 2018


   The MCT start with an initial condition (plain/cipher text, key, and
   optional IV) and perform a series of chained calculation.  For modes
   that use an IV, the IV is used in the beginning of each pseudorandom
   text.  There are separate rounds of MCT for encryption and
   decryption.  Because some block cipher modes rely on an IV and
   perform calculations differently from other modes, there are specific
   definitions of MCT for many of the block cipher modes.

3.2.1.  AES Monte Carlo Test - ECB mode

   The initial condition for the test is the tuple (KEY, PT) set to some
   values.

   The algorithm is shown in Figure 1.

                         AES-ECB Monte Carlo Test


   Key[0] = KEY
   PT[0] = PT
   For i = 0 to 99
             Output Key[i]
             Output PT[0]
             For j = 0 to 999
                  CT[j] = AES(Key[i], PT[j])
                  PT[j+1] = CT[j]
             Output CT[j]
             If ( keylen = 128 )
                  Key[i+1] = Key[i] xor CT[j]
             If ( If ( keylen = 192 )
                  Key[i+1] = Key[i] xor (last 64-bits of
                             CT[j-1] || CT[j])
             If ( keylen = 256 )
                  Key[i+1] = Key[i] xor (CT[j-1] || CT[j])
             PT[0] = CT[j]

                                 Figure 1

   Note: The pseudocode for decryption can be obtained by replacing all
   PT's with CT's and all CT's with PT's.

4.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual crypto algorithm, such as AES-
   ECB, AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM, DES-CBC, DES-CTR, etc.  This section
   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with symmetric
   crypto algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the JSON elements of the Test Group JSON
   object.

5.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it must
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

Appendix B.  Example Vector Set Request/Responses JSON Object

   The following sections provide examples of the JSON objects for each
   of the AES algorithms.  Examples will relfect what testTypes are
   supported by each algorithm, ie AFT, MCT or counter.  MCT examples
   have only 2 iterations shown for brevity.

   The following shows AES-GCM AFT request vectors.

   carry all fields to assist in any failure diagnosis.
