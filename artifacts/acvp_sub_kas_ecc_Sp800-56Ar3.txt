1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This

   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing KAS ECC
   algorithms using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

2.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the KAS protocol in order
   to assess the correctness and robustness of the implementation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session SHALL require multiple tests to be
   performed for every supported permutation of KAS capabilities.  This
   section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of KAS algorithms.  There are two test types for KAS
   testing:

      "AFT" - Algorithm Function Test.  In the AFT test mode, the IUT
      SHALL act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server.
      The server SHALL generate and provide all necessary information
      for the IUT to perform a successful key agreement; both the server
      and IUT MAY act as party U/V, as well as recipient/provider to key
      confirmation.

      "VAL" - Validation test.  In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server
      MUST generate a complete (from both party U and party V's
      perspectives) key agreement, and expects the IUT to be able to
      determine if that agreement is valid.  Various types of errors
      MSUT be introduced in varying portions of the key agreement
      process (changed DKM, changed key, changed hash digest, etc), that
      the IUT MUST be able to detect and report on.

2.1.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [SP800-56Ar3] .

2.1.1.  KAS-ECC Requirements Covered

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions.  SHA1, SHA2, and
      SHA3 hash functions SHALL be available for the various pieces of
      KAS requiring use of a hash function; such as approved MACs and
      OneStep KDF.

      AES-CMAC, HMAC, and KMAC algorithms SHALL be available for testing
      under KDFs and KC as the specification states.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.3 Random Number Generation.  Though random values
      are used, the testing of the construction of those random values
      SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.4 Nonces.  Though nonces are used, the testing of
      the construction of those nonces SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP
      testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.5 Domain Parameters.  Domain Parameters SHALL be
      used in the testing of KAS as per the specification, though the
      generation of those parameters is outside the scope of testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation.  Each KAS scheme from one
      or both parties utilizes a key pair for arriving at a shared
      secret, and deriving a key.  Though a key pair(s) are utilized in
      ACVP testing, the testing of the generation of said key pairs is
      outside the scope of this testing.

      document.

      SP 800-56Cr1 - 4 One-Step Key Derivation.  One-Step Key Derivation
      testing SHALL be supported by the ACVP server.  FixedInfo
      construction is covered within the ACVP specification, and can be
      tailored to the IUTs needs.  ASN.1 format of fixedInfo
      construction (currently) is NOT supported.

      SP 800-56Cr1 - 5 Two-Step Key Derivation.  Two-Step Key Derivation
      testing SHALL be supported by the ACVP server.  FixedInfo
      construction is covered within the ACVP specification, and can be

      tailored to the IUTs needs.  ASN.1 format of fixedInfo
      construction (currently) is NOT supported.

      SP 800-108 - 4 Pseudorandom Function (PRF).  All iterations of the
      KDF described in SP800-108 use a separate PRF.  All
      implementations of the PRF SHALL be available for testing through
      the ACVP server generated tests.

      SP 800-108 - 5 Key Derivation Functions (KDF).  The three
      implementations of KDFs in SP800-108 SHALL be available for
      testing through the ACVP Server.

2.1.2.  KAS-ECC Requirements Not Covered

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 4.3 DLC-based Key-Transport Process.  KeyWrapping
      is not incorporated into ACVP testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.3 Random Number Generation.  Though random values
      are used, the testing of the construction of those random values
      SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.4 Nonces.  Though nonces are used, the testing of
      the construction of those nonces SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP
      testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.5 Domain Parameters.  Domain Parameters SHALL be
      used in the testing of KAS as per the specification, though the
      generation of those parameters is outside the scope of testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation.  Each KAS scheme from one
      or both parties utilizes a key pair for arriving at a shared
      secret, and deriving a key.  Though a key pair(s) are utilized in
      ACVP testing, the testing of the generation of said key pairs is
      outside the scope of this testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6.2 Required Assurances.  IUT assurance testing
      is outside the scope of ACVP testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6.2 Key Pair Management.  Testing the IUT's
      management of Key Pairs is outside the scope of ACVP testing.

      SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.8.1.2 The ASN.1 Format for FixedInfo.  The ACVP
      server (currently) SHALL NOT support the testing of this format of
      fixed info.

      fixedInfo construction (currently) is NOT supported.

      SP 800-56Cr1 - 5 Two-Step Key Derivation.  ASN.1 format of
      fixedInfo construction (currently) is NOT supported.

      SP 800-56Cr1 - 7 Selecting Hash Functions and MAC Algorithms.  The
      process that goes into the selection of Hash functions and MAC
      algorithms SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing, though the ACVP
      server SHALL support all indicated Hash and MAC functions.

      SP 800-56Cr1 - 7 Selecting Hash Functions and MAC Algorithms.  The
      process that goes into the selection of Hash functions and MAC
      algorithms SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing, though the ACVP
      server SHALL support all indicated Hash and MAC functions.

3.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP REQUIRES crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of KAS ECC algorithms to the
   ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each KDF algorithm capability advertised is a
   self-contained JSON object.

3.1.  Prerequisite Algorithms for KAS ECC Validations

   Some algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, IKEv2 uses an underlying SHA algorithm.
   Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated,
   either separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

5.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual KAS ECC function.  This section
   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with KAS ECC
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

                     Table 13: Vector Set JSON Object

5.1.  Test Groups JSON Schema

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the secure hash JSON elements of the Test
   Group JSON object.

   The test group for KAS/KTS ECC is as follows:

   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

              Table 20: Vector Set Group Response JSON Object

   The testCase section is used to organize the ACVP client response in
   a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.
