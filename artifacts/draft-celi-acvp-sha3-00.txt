1.  Introduction

   The Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a
   mechanism to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of
   a software or hardware cryptographic module.  The intention of the
   protocol is to minimize human involvement in the testing of
   cryptography.  The ACVP specification defines how a cryptographic
   module communicates with an ACVP server, including cryptographic
   capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication, vector
   processing and more.  Note that the ACVP specification does not
   define algorithm-specific JSON constructs for performing the
   cryptographic validation.  However, a series of ACVP sub-
   specifications defines the constructs for testing individual
   cryptographic algorithms.  Each sub-specification addresses a
   specific class or subset of cryptographic algorithms.  This sub-
   specification defines the JSON constructs for testing the SHA3 and
   SHAKE algorithms using ACVP.  The ACVP server performs a set of tests
   on the hash algorithms in order to assess the correctness and
   robustness of the implementation.  A typical ACVP validation session

   would require multiple tests to be performed for every supported
   cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA3-256, SHA3-512 and SHAKE-256.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Supported Hash Algorithms

   The following SHA3-based hash algorithms may be advertised by this
   ACVP compliant crypto module:

   o  SHA3-224

   o  SHA3-256

   o  SHA3-384

   o  SHA3-512

   o  SHAKE-128

   o  SHAKE-256

   Other hash algorithms may be advertised by the ACVP elsewhere.

3.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of SHA3 and SHAKE.  There are three types of tests
   for these hash functions: functional tests, Monte Carlo tests and
   Variable Output tests.  Each has a specific value to be used in the
   testType field.  The testType field definitions are:

   o  "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  XXX

   o  "MCT" - Monte Carlo Test.  XXX See Section 3.1 for implementation
      details.

   o  "VOT" - Variable Output Test.  XXX

4.  Capabilities Registration

   This section describes the constructs for advertising support of
   block cipher algorithms to the ACVP server.  ACVP REQURIES
   cryptographic modules to register their capabilities in a
   registration.  This allows the cryptographic module to advertise
   support for specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which
   algorithms need test vectors generated for the validation process.

   The SHA3 and SHAKE capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects
   within the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value MUST be an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value MUST be part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP
   JSON registration message.  See the ACVP Protocol Specification
   Section XXX for details on the registration message.  Each SHA3 and
   SHAKE algorithm capability advertised SHALL be a self-contained JSON
   object.

   Each algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON object.
   The following JSON values are used for hash algorithm capabilities:

5.  Test Vectors

   After receiving a valid registration of a cryptographic module, the
   ACVP server SHALL provide test vectors in the form of a prompt to the
   ACVP client, which then SHALL be processed and returned to the ACVP
   server for validation.  A typical ACVP validation session would
   require the client to download and process multiple test vector sets.
   Each test vector set SHALL represent an individual cryptographic
   algorithm, such as SHA3-256, SHA3-512, SHAKE-128.  This section
   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with SHA3 and
   SHAKE algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta-data for the entire vector set.  The test vector set
   SHALL be comprised of test groups which SHALL subsequently contain
   individual test cases to be processed by the ACVP client.  The
   following table describes the REQUIRED JSON elements at the top level
   of the hierarchy:

5.1.  Test Groups

   Test vector sets MUST contain one or many test groups, each sharing
   similar properties.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same
   key size would be grouped together.  The testGroups element at the
   top level of the test vector JSON object SHALL be the array of test
   groups.  The Test Group JSON object MUST contain meta-data that
   applies to all test cases within the group.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements that MUST appear from the server in the
   Test Group JSON object:

   Note: All properties listed in the above table are REQUIRED except
   for outLen which is only REQUIRED when the algorithm is SHAKE-128 or
   SHAKE-256.

5.3.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it SHALL
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server within the alloted
   timeframe.  The following table describes the JSON object that
   represents a vector set response.

   The testGroup Response section is used to organize the ACVP client

Appendix B.  Example Test Vectors JSON Object

   The following is an example JSON object for secure hash test vectors
   sent from the ACVP server to the crypto module.  Notice that the
   single bit message is represented as "01".  This complies with the
   little-endian nature of SHA3.  All hex displayed is little-endian bit
   order when associated with SHA3 or any of its variations.
