1.  Introduction

   The Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a
   mechanism to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of
   a software or hardware cryptographic module.  The intention of the
   protocol is to minimize human involvement in the testing of
   cryptography.  The ACVP specification defines how a cryptographic
   module communicates with an ACVP server, including cryptographic
   capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication, vector
   processing and more.  Note that the ACVP specification does not
   define algorithm-specific JSON constructs for performing the
   cryptographic validation.  However, a series of ACVP sub-
   specifications defines the constructs for testing individual
   cryptographic algorithms.  Each sub-specification addresses a
   specific class or subset of cryptographic algorithms.  This sub-
   specification defines the JSON constructs for testing hash
   cryptographic algorithms using ACVP.  The ACVP server performs a set
   of tests on the hash functions in order to assess the correctness and
   robustness of the implementation.  A typical ACVP validation session
   would require multiple tests to be performed for every supported
   cryptographic algorithm, such as SHA-1, SHA2-256 and SHA2-512.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Supported Hash Algorithms

   The following hash algorithms MAY be advertised by the ACVP compliant
   cryptographic module:

   o  SHA-1

   o  SHA2-224

   o  SHA2-256

   o  SHA2-384

   o  SHA2-512

   o  SHA2-512/224

   o  SHA2-512/256

3.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of SHA-1 and SHA-2.  There are two types of tests for
   SHA-1 and SHA-2: functional tests and Monte Carlo tests.  Each has a
   specific value to be used in the testType field.  The testType field
   definitions are:

   o  "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  These tests can be processed
      by the client using a normal 'hash' operation.  AFTs cause the
      implementation under test to exercise nomral operations on a
      single block, multiple blocks, or partial blocks.  In all cases,
      random data is used.  The functional tests are designed to verify
      that the logical components of the hash function (block chunking,
      block padding etc.) are operating correctly.

   o  "MCT" - Monte Carlo Test.  These tests exercise the implementation
      under test under strenuous circumstances.  The implementation
      under test must process the test vectors according to the correct
      algorithm and mode in this document.  MCTs can help detect
      potential memory leaks over time, and problems in allocation of
      resources, addressing variables, error handling, and generally
      improper behavior in response to random inputs.  Each MCT

      processes 100 pseudorandom tests.  Each algorithm and mode SHOULD
      have at least one MCT group.  See Section 3.1 for implementation
      details.

3.1.  Monte Carlo tests for SHA-1 and SHA-2

   The MCTs start with an initial condition (SEED which is a single
   message) and perform a series of chained computations.

   The algorithm is shown in Figure 1.

                     SHA-1 and SHA-2 Monte Carlo Test


   For j = 0 to 99
   MD[0] = MD[1] = MD[2] = SEED
           For i = 3 to 1003
                   MSG[i] = MD[i-3] || MD[i-2] || MD[i-1]
                   MD[i] = SHA(MSG[i])
           Output MD[1002]


                                 Figure 1

3.2.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [FIPS-180-4].

3.2.1.  SHA Requirements Covered

   Sections 3 and 4 in [FIPS-180-4] outline the core functions used
   within the hash algorithms.  Normal AFTs test these operations.
   Section 5 outlines the hash function preprocessing.  It is worth
   noting that not all test cases will cover the message padding
   process, but through the entire vector set, this operation will be
   fully tested.

3.2.2.  SHA Requirements Not Covered

   Section 1 in [FIPS-180-4] outlines the maximum message sizes for each
   hash function.  Due to the large size (either 2^64 or 2^128 bits) of
   these maximums, they are not tested by this specification.  Section 7
   outlines digest truncation for applications where a shortened digest
   is needed.  These operations are not tested via this specification.

4.  Capabilities Registration

   This section describes the constructs for advertising support of hash
   algorithms to the ACVP server.  ACVP REQUIRES cryptographic modules
   to register their capabilities in a registration.  This allows the
   cryptographic module to advertise support for specific algorithms,
   notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test vectors
   generated for the validation process.

   The hash algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects
   within the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value MUST be an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value MUST be part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP
   JSON registration message.  See the ACVP Protocol Specification
   Section XXX for details on the registration message.  Each hash
   algorithm capability advertised SHALL be a self-contained JSON
   object.

   +---------------+------------------------------------------+--------+

             Table 1: Hash Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

   The value of the algorithm property MUST be one of the elements from
   the list in Section 2.

5.  Test Vectors

   After receiving a valid registration of a cryptographic module, the
   ACVP server SHALL provide test vectors in the form of a prompt to the
   ACVP client, which then SHALL be processed and returned to the ACVP
   server for validation.  A typical ACVP validation session would
   require the client to download and process multiple test vector sets.
   Each test vector set SHALL represent an individual cryptographic
   algorithm, such as SHA-1, SHA2-256, SHA2-512, etc.  This section

   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with hash
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta-data for the entire vector set.  The test vector set
   SHALL be comprised of test groups which SHALL subsequently contain
   individual test cases to be processed by the ACVP client.  The
   following table describes the REQUIRED JSON elements at the top level
   of the hierarchy:

   +------------+---------------------------------------+--------------+

                      Table 2: Vector Set JSON Object

5.1.  Test Groups

   Test vector sets MUST contain one or many test groups, each sharing
   similar properties.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same
   testType would be grouped together.  The testGroups element at the
   top level of the test vector JSON object SHALL be the array of test
   groups.  The Test Group JSON object MUST contain meta-data that
   applies to all test cases within the group.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements that MAY appear from the server in the
   Test Group JSON object:

Appendix B.  Example Test Vectors JSON Object

   The following is an example JSON object for secure hash test vectors
   sent from the ACVP server to the crypto module.  Note the single bit
   message is represented as "80".  This complies with SHA1 and SHA2
   being big-endian by nature.  All hex strings associated with SHA1 and
   SHA2 will be big-endian.
