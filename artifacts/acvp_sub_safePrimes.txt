1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-

   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing SafePrimes
   algorithms using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

2.  Supported SafePrimes Algorithms

   The following SafePrimes algorithms MAY be advertised by the ACVP
   compliant cryptographic module:

   o  safePrimes / keyGen

   o  safePrimes / keyVer

3.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the specified SafePrimes
   algorithm in order to assess the correctness and robustness of the
   implementation.  A typical ACVP validation session SHALL require
   multiple tests to be performed for every supported permutation of
   SafePrimes capabilities.  This section describes the design of the
   tests used to validate implementations of the SafePrimes algorithms.

      SafePrimes / keyGen "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  The IUT is
      REQUIRED for each test case provided, to generate a key pair based
      on a SafePrime group.  This information is then communicated to
      the ACVP server and validated.

      SafePrimes / keyVer "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  The ACVP
      server generates a series of keys to communicate to the IUT.  The
      IUT is REQUIRED to determine the validity of the given the key
      pair, and safe prime group.

3.1.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [SP800-56Ar3] , [RFC3526] , and
   [RFC7919] .

3.1.1.  Requirements Covered

      SP800-56Ar3 - 5.6.1.1.1 Using the Approved Safe-Prime Groups.
      This ACVP server specification makes testing available/validatable
      for use in Safe-Prime Groups key generation for KAS-FFC as
      specified in SP800-56Ar3.

      RFC3526 - All safe prime groups defined in this document are made
      available for testing via the ACVP server.

      RFC7919 - All safe prime groups defined in this document are made
      available for testing via the ACVP server.

3.1.2.  Requirements Not Covered

   N/A

4.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of SafePrimes algorithms to
   the ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.

4.1.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for SafePrimes Validations

   Each SafePrimes implementation relies on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, SafePrimes uses an underlying SHA
   algorithm.  Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be
   validated, either separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP
   provides a mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

   vector set represents an individual SafePrimes function.  This
   section describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with
   SafePrimes algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the secure hash JSON elements of the Test
   Group JSON object.

   The test group for SafePrimes is as follows:

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector

   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual SafePrimes function.  This
   section describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with
   SafePrimes algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

6.1.1.  Test Groups SafePrimes.KeyVer JSON Schema

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the secure hash JSON elements of the Test
   Group JSON object.

   The test group for SafePrimes is as follows:
