1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the

   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing ECDSA
   algorithms using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Supported ECDSA Algorithms

   The following ECDSA algorithms MAY be advertised by the ACVP
   compliant cryptographic module:

   o  ECDSA / keyGen

   o  ECDSA / keyVer

   o  ECDSA / sigGen

   o  ECDSA / sigVer

3.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the specified ECDSA
   algorithm in order to assess the correctness and robustness of the
   implementation.  A typical ACVP validation session SHALL require
   multiple tests to be performed for every supported permutation of
   ECDSA capabilities.  This section describes the design of the tests
   used to validate implementations of the ECDSA algorithms.

      ECDSA / keyGen "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  The IUT is
      REQUIRED for each test case provided, to generate a key pair based
      on an approved curve.  This information is then communicated to
      the ACVP server and validated.

      ECDSA / keyVer "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  The ACVP server
      is REQUIRED to generate a series of keys based on the IUT provided
      NIST curve(s).  The keys generated by the server MAY or MAY NOT be
      valid, the IUT is REQUIRED to determine if the keys provided in
      the test cases are valid or invalid keys as they relate to the
      curve.

      ECDSA / sigGen "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  This testing
      mode expects the IUT to generate valid signatures based on the
      ACVP provided message.  The signature is then validated with the

      ACVP server given the IUT's communicated curve, public key, and
      signature.

      ECDSA / sigVer "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  The ACVP server
      generates a series of signatures to communicate to the IUT.  The
      IUT is REQUIRED to determine the validity of the signature given
      the curve, key, and message.

3.1.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [FIPS.186-4] and [SP.800-89].

3.1.1.  Requirements Covered

      FIPS.186-4 - 3 General Discussion.  Domain parameter generation,
      key generation, signature generation, and signature validation are
      all within scope of ACVP server testing.

      FIPS.186-4 - 6 The Eliliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
      (ECDSA).  The ACVP server SHALL allow testing with the recommended
      NIST curves.  The ACVP server SHALL support a variety of curves/
      hash function for creation and delivery to/from the IUT.  Key pair
      generation/verification testing SHALL be provided by the ACVP
      server.  Both Signature Generation and Validation testing
      mechanmisms SHALL be provided by the ACVP server.

      SP800-106 - (3) Randomized Hashing and (4) Digital Signatures
      Using Randomized Hashing.  The IUT SHALL be provided or provide a
      random value that should be used to "randomize" a message prior to
      signing and/or verifying an original message.

3.1.2.  Requirements Not Covered

      FIPS.186-4 - 3 General Discussion.  Assurances of private key
      secrecy and ownership SHALL NOT be within scope of ACVP testing.

      FIPS.186-4 - 6 The Eliliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
      (ECDSA).  Though the ACVP server SHALL support a variety of
      parameter sizes/hash functions, the IUT's selection of these is
      out of scope of testing.  The ACVP server SHALL NOT provide
      testing for the validity of domain parameters as testing is
      (currently) limited to approved NIST curves.  Testing SHALL NOT
      provide assurances the IUT has validated a set of domain
      parameters prior to their use.  Domain parameter and key pair
      management SHALL NOT be within scope of ACVP testing.

      SP800-106 - 3.3 The Random Value.  DSA, ECDSA, and RSA have random
      values generated as per their signing process, this random value
      can be used as the input to the message randomization function,
      doing so however is out of scope of this testing.

4.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of ECDSA algorithms to the
   ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.

4.1.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for ECDSA Validations

   Each ECDSA implementation relies on other cryptographic primitives.
   For example, ECDSA uses an underlying SHA algorithm.  Each of these
   underlying algorithm primitives must be validated, either separately
   or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for
   specifying the required prerequisites:

4.3.  Supported ECDSA Modes Capabilities

   The ECDSA mode capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'capabilities' value of the ACVP registration message - see Table 2 .
   The 'capabilities' value is an array, where each array element is a
   JSON object corresponding to a particular ECDSA mode defined in this
   section.  The 'capabilities' value is part of the
   'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON registration message.
   See the ACVP specification for details on the registration message.

   Each ECDSA mode's capabilities are advertised as JSON objects.

4.3.1.  The keyGen Mode Capabilities

   The ECDSA keyGen mode capabilities are advertised as JSON objects,
   which are elements of the 'capabilities' array in the ACVP

6.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual ECDSA function.  This section
   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with ECDSA
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

6.1.  Test Groups JSON Schema

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the secure hash JSON elements of the Test
   Group JSON object.

   The test group for ECDSA is as follows:
