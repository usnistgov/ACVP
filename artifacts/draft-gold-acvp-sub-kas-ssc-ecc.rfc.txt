2.  Abstract

   This document defines the JSON schema for testing KAS-SSC-ECC
   SP800-56Ar3 implementations with the ACVP specification.

3.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing KAS-SSC-ECC
   SP800-56Ar3 implementations using ACVP.

4.  Terms and definitions

   No terms and definitions are listed in this document.

Internet-Draft        ACVP KAS SSC ECC SP800-56Ar3             June 2020


5.  Supported KAS SSC ECC

   The following KAS algorithms MAY be advertised by this ACVP compliant
   crypto module:

   *  KAS-SSC-ECC

   Other KAS algorithms MAY be advertised by the ACVP module elsewhere.

6.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate KAS-
   SSC-ECC SP800-56Ar3 implementations.

6.1.  Test Types

   *  "AFT" - Algorithm Function Test.  In the AFT test mode, the IUT
      SHALL act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server.
      The server SHALL generate and provide all necessary information
      for the IUT to compute a shared secret "z"; both the server and
      IUT MAY act as party U/V.

   *  "VAL" - Validation test.  In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server
      MUST generate a complete (from both party U and party V's
      perspectives) shared secret "z", and expects the IUT to be able to
      determine if that shared secret is valid.  Various types of
      conditions/errors MUST be introduced in varying portions of the
      key agreement process (changed Z, Z with leading zero nibble,
      etc), that the IUT MUST be able to detect and report on.

6.2.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to SP800-56Ar3 KAS Shared Secret
   Computation (SSC).

6.2.1.  Requirements Covered

   *  SP 800-56a - 4.1 Key Establishment Preparations.  The ACVP server
      is responsible for generating domain parameters as per the IUT's
      capability registration.

   *  SP 800-56a - 4.2 Key-Agreement Process.  Both the ACVP server and
      IUT participate in the shared secret computation.  The server and
      IUT can both take the roles of party U/V, and as such the
      "performer" of steps depicted in "Figure 2: Key Agreement process"
      can vary.

Internet-Draft        ACVP KAS SSC ECC SP800-56Ar3             June 2020


   *  SP 800-56a - 5.6 Domain Parameters.  Domain Parameter Generation
      SHALL be performed solely from the ACVP server, with constraints
      from the IUTs capabilities registration.  The same set of domain
      parameters SHALL generate all keypairs (party U/V, static/
      ephemeral) for a single test case.

   *  SP 800-56a - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation.  While Key-Pairs are used in
      each KAS scheme, the generation of said key-pairs is out of scope
      for KAS testing.  Random tests from the VAL groups, MAY inject bad
      keypairs that the IUT MUST be able detect.  These random tests are
      only present in groups given appropriate assurance functions see:
      Section 3.3

   *  SP 800-56a - 4.3 DLC-based Key-Transport Process / 5.7 DLC
      Primitives.  Depending on the scheme used, either Diffie Hellman
      or MQV SHALL be used to negotiate a shared secret of z.  Testing
      and validation of such key exchanges is covered under their
      respective schemes.

   *  SP 800-56a - 6 Key Agreement Schemes.  All schemes specified in
      referenced document are supported for validation with the ACVP
      server.

6.2.2.  Requirements Not Covered

   *  KAS SSC testing only covers testing of SP800-56Ar2 through the
      computation of a shared secret "z".  Additional functions of KAS
      as a whole such as KDF, KC, etc.  MAY be covered within the scope
      of the full KAS testing; please see that document for further
      details.

7.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of KAS-SSC-ECC SP800-56Ar3
   algorithms to the ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within
   the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification [ACVP] for more
   details on the registration message.

7.1.  Prerequisites

   Each algorithm implementation MAY rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, RSA Signature algorithms depend on an
   underlying hash function.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

   Prerequisites, if applicable, MUST be submitted in the registration
   as the "prereqVals" JSON property array inside each element of the
   "algorithms" array.  Each element in the "prereqVals" array MUST
   contain the following properties

        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | JSON Property | Description                 | JSON Type |
        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | algorithm     | a prerequisite algorithm    | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | valValue      | algorithm validation number | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

   A "valValue" of "same" SHALL be used to indicate that the
   prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability
   exchange in the same registration.

   An example description of prerequisites within a single algorithm
   capability exchange looks like this

   "prereqVals":
   [
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg1",
       "valValue": "Val-1234"
     },
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg2",
       "valValue": "same"
     }
   ]

7.2.  Property Registration

   The KAS-SSC-ECC SP800-56Ar3 mode capabilities are advertised as JSON
   objects within a root "algorithm" object.

   A registration SHALL use these properties:

8.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation test session would require multiple test
   vector sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each
   test vector set represents an individual algorithm defined during the
   capability exchange.  This section describes the JSON schema for a
   test vector set used with KAS-SSC-ECC SP800-56Ar3 algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table

8.1.  Test Groups

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the KAS-SSC-ECC SP800-56Ar3 JSON elements
   of the Test Group JSON object

                      Table 5: Test Group Properties

   The 'tgId', 'testType' and 'tests' objects MUST appear in every test
   group element communicated from the server to the client as a part of
   a prompt.  Other properties are dependent on which 'testType' the
   group is addressing.

8.2.  Test Cases

   Each test group contains an array of one or more test cases.  Each
   test case is a JSON object that represents a single test vector to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each KAS-SSC-ECC SP800-56Ar3 test vector.

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it must
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.
