              Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol
                       draft-fussell-acvp-spec-00

Abstract

   The ACV Protocol provides a method for communication between a
   cryptographic module that is embedded inside of a device or otherwise
   running on a platform accessible via computer network, and an
   external testing system, using standard network communication
   interfaces and protocols.  This communication protocol can also be
   used to validate the correctness of the algorithm implementations in
   the cryptographic module with a validation authority.

1.  Introduction

   The ACV Protocol(ACVP) introduces a method to perform cryptographic
   assessment and validations at a rate which meets typical industry
   development cycles.  This provides the ability to deploy validated
   crypto with CVE fixes much faster than previous methods.  This
   document describes how it is structured with respect to the client-
   server model, the messaging protocol, optional features and flows.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   ACVP has the following goals:

   o  To work in situations where the testing system is remote from the
      cryptographic module, e.g. running as a process on a separate
      device.

   o  To enable automated testing that can take place with a minimum of
      human interaction.

   o  To enable the testing system to discover the capabilities of the
      module being tested; that is, the particular algorithms and
      parameters that the module supports.

   o  To provide extensibility that can be used to introduce tests for
      new algorithms, and new tests for existing algorithms.

   o  To be compatible with emerging automated validation systems
      wherever possible, especially the FIPS-140 Cryptographic Algorithm
      Validation Program.

   o  To provide a standard communication method so that vendors can
      utilize the same testing service for FIPS-140, 3rd party crypto
      verification and product FCS readiness testing.

   ACVP defines how to communicate a request (to execute a cryptographic
   operation) to a cryptographic module, and how to communicate the
   corresponding response (containing the output of that operation) back

   to a testing system.  It defines a transport (based on HTTP or HTTPS
   [RFC7230]), an encoding and message format (which is negotiated), and
   a set of message exchanges.  Each vector test set corresponds to a
   single message exchange driven from the client associated with the
   module under test.  ACVP does not define the cryptographic
   algorithms, nor does it detail the precise conditions for a response
   to be acceptable.  Instead, it references existing specifications for
   those algorithms, and defines a mapping between the data on the wire
   and the algorithm testing specification.  ACVP does not define
   detailed conformance criteria, such as those in FIPS-140.  Instead,
   it aims to be independent of particular conformance criteria, so that
   it can be used in multiple domains with different (even potentially
   conflicting) conformance criteria.  ACVP does not define an interface
   that can be used to manage or control a cryptographic module.

3.1.  Audience

   This document is written to address multiple audiences:

   o  Crypto module developers who require validation testing

   o  Crypto module developers who require runtime crypto assessment
      testing

   o  Crypto validation organizations who will perform validation
      testing

   o  Crypto module customers that desire validation testing results or
      verifiable artifacts of testing

3.2.  Goals

   The goals for this document are to provide a messaging protocol that
   can be used with existing authentication and communication protocols
   to provide a way to test crypto modules.  The following functions are
   outside the scope of this document:

   o  The API to the cryptographic module

   o  How the tests are generated

   o  How the results/artifacts are stored or managed

   o  Authentication used

   o  Scalability

   o  Management interface

   With that in mind there are several expectations when building a
   server used as a validation authority.  A validation authority SHALL
   use HTTPS [RFC7230], TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] or greater and mutual
   authentication.  Therefore a client that expects to be used with a
   validation authority SHALL have the same requirements.  A server,
   proxy or client developed for the purposes of internal organizational
   testing only MAY chose not to include some of those features.

4.  Architecture

   A server/client/proxy model is used where the roles are defined as:

   o  ACV Client - Communicates with the ACV server using Java Script
      Object Notation (JSON) and collects the test vectors and returns
      the test results using product specific methods.

   o  ACV Server - Sends JSON formatted messaging and test data to the
      ACV client and processes test responses.

   o  ACV Proxy - Resides between the ACV server and ACV client to proxy
      the connection for the client.  This is particularly useful when
      the client does not support TLS, key management or have signature
      capabilities and they are required by the server.  An example
      architecture is provided in Figure 3.

   o  Device Under Test - Contains the crypto module under test which
      can include various algorithms and functions that encrypt/decrypt,
      generate keys, signatures, perform varifications and DRBG
      functions.  May also contain the ACVP client.

   o  Cryptographic Module API - This is the interface, manual or
      otherwise, to the crypto module.  This interface is environment
      specific and will vary depending on the crypto module and may not
      be limited to real-time operation.

4.4.  Terminology

   The following terms are consistently used throughout this document
   and SHOULD be used throughout its extensions:

   o  Test Session - The largest structure of an instance of ACVP.
      Often generated from a single registration, it will contain many
      Test Vector Sets for the algorithms defined in the registration.

   o  Test Vector Set - The set of tests and data corresponding to an
      individual algorithm from within a registration.  Uniquely
      identified throughout an instance of ACVP by the vsId.  Contains
      many Test Groups.

   o  Test Group - The set of tests that share common properties within
      a Test Vector Set.  Uniquely identified within the Test Vector Set
      by the tgId.  Contains many Test Cases.

   o  Test Case - The smallest unit of the tests that represents an
      individual testable operation as defined by the parent Test Group.
      Uniquely identified throughout the Test Vector Set by the tcId.

   o  Registration - The JSON from the client to the server that
      describes the algorithms and capabilities for which the client is
      seeking test cases and a validation.  A Registration can submit
      capabilities for multiple algorithms.  Each algorithm will be
      broken into individual Test Vector Sets.

   o  Prompt - The JSON sent from the server to the client defining a
      single Test Vector Set to use as inputs for testing.  Exactly one
      prompt will exist for each Test Vector Set.

   o  Response - The JSON from the client providing the desired
      cryptographic output for each of the Test Cases defined in the
      corresponding Prompt file.  These are linked via the Test Vector
      Set vsId.  As exactly one prompt exists for each vsId, one
      response will exist for each prompt.

   o  Disposition - The JSON from the server after the Response is
      submitted by the client detailing the correctness of the Test
      Cases.  A "passed" disposition indicates that the particular
      algorithm in the Test Vector Set is ready for validation.

   o  OE - Operational Environment - The specific hardware and/or
      software the client's cryptographic implementation uses to run.

   o  Realtime - For the purposes of this document realtime is defined
      as the client receiving a vector set and immediately performing
      the tests and returning the results to the server.  In general,
      this is a case where the ACVP client and crypto module reside in
      the same box and directly communicate with each other.  Non-
      realtime would refer to the case where the client may gather
      vector sets from the server and through some means introduce them
      to the crypto module gather the results and send them back to the
      server.  In general, this is a case where the device hosting the
      crypto module cannot communicate directly with the ACVP client.

5.  ACV Protocol

   The ACV protocol will utilize existing mechanisms for transport
   coordinated with JSON formatted messaging.

                             Protocol Layering

   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | JSON Formatted ACVP request/response messages |
   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | HTTP[S] message transfer and signaling        |
   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | TLS for transport security(recommended)       |
   +-----------------------------------------------+
   | TCP for transport                             |

                                 Figure 5

   Note that deployments utilizing ACV Proxy server MAY use a different
   protocol, e.g., HTTP, custom server, context and port number to
   interact with the DUT.

5.2.  HTTP URI Resources

   In the table below, any parts of a resource path enclosed in curly
   braces, { or }, are replaced by an instance of what is described in
   the braces.  For example {testSessionId} could be replaced with 1.

   An empty cell for a resource and HTTP Method combination denotes that
      the server returns an HTTP Status 405 code _Method not allowed
                                  (405)_.

             Table 1: Resources and their available operations

   The resource path is appended to the path prefix to form the URI used
   with an HTTP Method to perform the desired ACVP operation.  For
   example to create a new test session using the "/testSessions"
   resource is "/acvp/v1/testSessions" (assuming an empty context).  To
   create a new Test Session, the ACVP client would use the following
   HTTP request-line:

   POST /acvp/v1/testSessions HTTP/1.1

   Likewise, to request a specific vector set from the server the ACVP
   client would use the following request-line:

   GET /acvp/v1/testSessions/1/vectorSets/1 HTTP/1.1

6.  Security Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that HTTPS and TLS 1.2 or greater be used in order
   to enforce a secure communication method.  Not all environments will
   have TLS so HTTP with some level of authentication may be the only
   option.

6.1.  Authentication

   It is RECOMMENDED that an authentication scheme be used.  Typically,
   a JSON Web Token (JWT) is created by the server upon successful
   client authentication and returned to the client to use as an
   authorization mechanism for accessing the server resources - see
   Section 9.3 below for more information.  Depending on the target
   environment and usage objectives, the authentication can be as weak
   as basic HTTP authentication or as strong as TLS mutual certificate
   authentication.  Definition of an authentication scheme will not be
   discussed here, but should be agreed upon between the client and
   server owning entities including the servers owned by the validation
   authorities.  For the purposes of the message flow examples, no
   authentication will be used.

7.  Encoding

   The encoding used for the request/response messaging will be JSON.
   The data will be identified by: Content-type: application/json In
   order to allow environment specific extensions to a particular
   version of the ACV protocol, a top-level JSON keyword, extensions
   will be used to extend the OE description and/or the capabilities.
   Extensions MAY be ignored by the ACV server.  Vector and vector
   response data will be JSON encoded.

8.  Versioning

   The version of the ACVP protocol will be carried with each message
   and will contain a simple major.minor format.  Major version changes
   will not be backward compatible, however additions and enhancements
   that do not disrupt compatibility will be indicated with a minor
   version change.  A server MAY accept a down-level version from the
   client if it can process at a lower level.  If not, it will reject
   the session.  All subsequent messages will carry the negotiated
   version value.

9.  Messaging and Workflow

9.1.  Product Registration/Capabilities Exchange

   The product registration will utilize the URI resources Section 5.2
   to register and provide cryptographic capabilities.  This exchange
   will consist of several message exchanges and carry the Company name,
   primary contact (OE information) as well as a detailed list of the
   supported cryptographic algorithms and their options to be tested
   during the testSession, see Figure 8.

9.2.  Test Exchange

   The test exchange consists of the ACV client requesting a particular
   vectorSet associated with the testSession.  The server responds with
   the vectorSet.  The client has the option to process the vectorSet
   and return results(realtime) or request more vectorSets for
   processing at a later time(non-realtime).  The client will repeat
   this process until all of the tests in the session test list have
   been processed.  Once a vectorSet result has been POSTed to the
   server the client may request success/failure results from the server
   at any time, however if vectorSets have not been completed the
   overall status will be incomplete.  A minimal message flow is
   described below Figure 8.

9.3.  JSON Web Token (JWT)

   JSON Web Token is described in RFC 7519 [RFC7519] and is used as an
   authorization mechanism for gaining access to different resources.

   An example JWT:

{
"alg" : "none"
}
   {
      "iss" : "nist.gov",
      "exp" : 1426420800,
      "company" : "MyCompany",
      "jti" : 0987654321,
      "pkey" : "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"
   }
   {
   Empty octet string (since alg is none).
   }

   The JWT can be secured if desired using the header encryption "alg"
   value defined to HS256(HMAC-SHA256) or one of the other secure
   values.  Key agreement would follow RFC7518.

   The first four claims are required, however "pkey" is an optional
   private claim used to pass the key used for encrypting the database
   at the server.  Enabling this option is discussed further in
   Section 9.10.2

9.3.1.  Authorization flows with JWT

   JSON Web Token is described in RFC 7519 [RFC7519] and is used as an
   authorization mechanism for gaining access to different resources.

   In order to access any resource which requires authorization a client
   must supply the JWT as an "Authorization" header value as a "Bearer"
   token.  An example header value is:

            Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiAibmlzdC5vcmciLCJleHAiOiAxNDYyOTg0OTUzLCJjb21wYW55IjogIkNpc2NvIiwianRpIjo0NTh9.zDhd3WrLcb1Xf5-VKOX6k-G70mACbi1tdir8qHAMPyQ

9.3.2.  JWT Expiration/Renewal

   The JWT access tokens received from either the /login server endpoint
   SHALL be set to expire after a pre-defined period, The specific
   length of the expiration period is out of scope for this
   specification.  However, the expiration period length impacts both
   the security and protocol overhead.  Longer expiration periods reduce
   the overhead but increase the window for attacks.  Attempting to
   access a service with an expired JWT SHALL result in a "401
   Unauthorized" HTTP status code.  A client may renew an expired JWT
   access token using the mechanism shown in Figure 7 below.

    JWT access token renewal flows.  All exchanges shown are over HTTP.

9.11.5.  Submit Results

   *POST /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/results*

   Initial Submission of Vector Set Test Results.

9.11.5.1.  Request

   The client will send this request to submit the test results for an
   individual vector set.  Similar to the vector set download the format
   will vary depending on the specific sub-specification of the
   algorithm and testType being tested.

   [

     {
       "vsId": 1437,
       "testGroups": [{
         "tgId": 1,

9.11.5.2.  Response

   No content response.  Standard HTTP status codes will indicate
   success or failure of the submission, but do not indicated the
   disposition of the tests.

9.11.6.  Update Results Submission

   *PUT /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/results*

   Update Vector Set Test Results Submission.

   When one or more test cases fails, the client will need to correct
   the issue in the crypto module and send the responses again.  The
   resending of responses for failed test cases will occur for an entire
   vector set.  Therefore, even if only a single test case in the vector
   set failed, the client will need to download, process, and upload
   responses to the server for the entire vector set (presumably after
   the problem has been corrected in the implementation).  The resending
   of vector set responses must occur prior to expiry.

9.11.6.1.  Request

   The request content is identical to the request content described in
   Section 9.11.5 .

9.11.7.  Retrieve Expected Results

   *GET /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/expected*

   Expected Test Results.

9.11.7.1.  Response

   The response is identical to the request content described in
   Section 9.11.5 .

10.  Vector Set Expiration

   Vector sets can expire.  For example, in terms of a validation
   authority use, the vector sets are one-time use only.  Old vector
   sets can never be reused to obtain a new validation certificate for
   an algorithm implementation or to update an existing certificate.
   Expiration is a server specific definition which depends on database
   costs, need for artifacts, etc.  If the vector set has expired, the
   server will reply with an expired response when the client attempts
   to download the vector set:

   [
       {"acvVersion": <acvp-version>},
       {
           "vsId": <vs-id>,
           "status": "expired"
       }
   ]

   The ACVP protocol requires server implementations to generate test
   values and retain the data while the ACVP client processes and
   returns the results.  Some crypto modules implementing the client-
   side ACVP protocol may not return results immediately.  The ACVP

Internet-Draft                ACV Protocol                 February 2019


   protocol design implies the server must retain the test values to
   verify the client test responses at some time in the future.
   However, some test vector sets are fairly large, which could place
   significant storage requirements on ACVP server implementations.  To
   alleviate long term storage requirements, ACVP allows for an
   expiration timestamp to be set when a test vector set is generated by
   the server.

   The vector set expiration timestamp must be included by the server in
   the vector set when the client downloads the vector set.  The server
   may change the expiration timestamp of a previously issued vector set
   to extend its lifetime subject to server policy.  The expiration
   timestamp must be in the 'expiry' JSON value, which is included in
   the JSON encoded vector set.  The expiry JSON value will be a string
   value of the UTC timestamp using form "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".  The
   following figure shows a partial JSON encoded vector set that
   contains the expiry value.

11.  Paging Parameters

   Some resources require paging in order to avoid returning large
   amounts of data.  To faciliate paging the following Query parameters
   SHOULD be allowed on resources where paging is necessary.

      "limit" - the number of entries to return

      "offset" - the offset into the list of entries

   The response will indicate the offset and the total count using
   "offset" and "total" properties.

12.  Error Codes

   Errors will follow HTTP[S] numbering scheme.  In addition errors as
   well as 200 messages may carry JSON encoded information that
   describes in detail the error and any associated troubleshooting
   information.  Examples of client and server error messages are in
   Appendix B.

13.  Algorithm Test Extensions

   ACVP is intended to be an extensible protocol that supports testing
   of a large number of cryptographic algorithms from several different
   classes defined by the community.  See Appendix C for details.  All
   algorithm identifiers intended for public use SHALL be documented by
   IANA in the ACVP IANA Registry [acvp-iana].

14.  Custom Specification Objects

14.1.  Date

   A date type is a time "string" formatted according to the rules of
   RFC 3339 [RFC3339]; all date/times must use UTC time denoted by 'Z'
   suffix with no local timezone adjustment.  Example is
   "2018-06-01T20:10:33Z"

14.2.  BitString

   Bitstrings are used to communicate a string of bits between the ACVP
   server and IUT.

14.2.1.  Endianness

   BitStrings SHALL be considered in big endian order, unless otherwise
   specified by the algorithm.

   The hex string "FA" (assuming all bits are considered) SHALL
   represent the bits 11111010 (in MSb) or the value 250.

14.2.2.  Hex to Bitstring Parsing

   "valueLen" will be used as the example, but it can apply to any bit
   length registration/vector set/etc parameters.

   When a "value" is provided along with a "valueLen", the "valueLen"
   MUST be considered when parsing the hex string represented in
   "value", EXCEPT in empty bitstring cases, which MUST be represented
   as an empty string "".  Parsing Hex strings into Bit strings is
   especially important for algorithms such as the SHA variations that



Fussell, et al.          Expires August 14, 2019               [Page 48]

Internet-Draft                ACV Protocol                 February 2019


   may only include a portion of bits from the provided hex string.
   When only a portion of bits from a Hex string are considered, bits
   for use in the bitstring SHALL be taken from the most significant
   bits, meaning the lesser significant bits are the bits that are
   dropped.

14.2.2.1.  Hex string parsing examples

   o  valueLen: 8, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 11111010, or
      the value 250.

   o  valueLen: 7, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 1111101, or
      the value 125.

   o  valueLen: 5, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 11111, or
      the value 31.

   o  valueLen: 3, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 111, or the
      value 7.

   o  valueLen: 0, value: "", SHALL be interpreted as an empty bit
      string.

14.3.  Range

   The Range object can be used to convey a range of values.  It
   contains its own set of properties made up of "min", "max", and
   "increment".

14.3.1.  Range JSON examples

   A range object specifying a minimum of 0, a maximum of 8, with an
   increment of 1.  This range object includes the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
   6, 7, and 8.


   {"myRange": {
       "min": 1,
       "max": 8,
       "increment": 1
   }}


   A range object specifying a minimum of 0, a maximum of 8, with an
   increment of 2.  This range object includes the values 0, 2, 4, 6,
   and 8.

   {"myRange": {
       "min": 0,
       "max": 8,
       "increment": 2
   }}


14.4.  Domain

   The Domain object can be used to specify a set of values similar to
   Range, albeit with more control.  A domain can be made up of an array
   of objects, where those objects can be literal values, and/or Range
   objects.

14.4.1.  Domain JSON examples

   Several sample domain objects that state 0, 8, 16, 32, 96, 128, 192,
   and 256 are valid values.


   {"myDomain": [
       {
           "min": 0,
           "max": 16,
           "increment": 8
       },
       32,
       96,
       {
           "min": 128,
           "max": 256,
           "increment": 64
       }
   ]}



   {"myDomain": [ 0, 8, 16,  32, 96,  128, 192, 256 ]}


14.4.2.  Additional Domain Information

   Because the Domain is an array of objects consisting of (potentially)
   both literals and ranges, algorithms that use an array of integers
   can be used interchangably with the Domain object.

15.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

16.  Other Considerations

   When an ACVP client is attached to a cryptographic module that is in
   use, access to ACVP MUST be controlled so that only an administrator
   or other authorized user can send and receive ACVP messages.  This is
   because an attacker that has access to ACVP can potentially use it to
   probe for weaknesses in the cryptographic module.

Appendix A.  JSON Formatting Guidelines

   All JSON keywords SHALL use lower camelCase format with no
   underscores or hyphens and use the following characters only a-z,
   A-Z, 0-9.  Keywords SHALL abbreviate common words and phrases
   wherever possible for brevity.

   For example: password length - pwLen plain text length - ptLen

   Keywords SHOULD be chosen such that they are informative and brief,
   for example:

   [ { "acvVersion": acvp-version }, { "results" : { "disposition" :
   "incomplete" } } ]

   Metadata assigned to the keyword may use any format which best
   reflects the information being represented including hyphens,
   underscores alternating case, numbers, etc.  However, brevity should
   be a major consideration, for example:

   "algorithms" : [ { "algorithm" : "AES-GCM", "mode" : "modes", "ivGen"
   : "internal", "ivGenMode" : "8.2.1" } All metadata representing
   strings or big numbers SHALL use double quotes at both ends.  Big
   numbers require conversion from strings to whatever format is used by
   the DUT.  Numerical values of integer size or with decimal points may
   use quotations if those values are generally used as a string, for
   example the acvVersion would generally be used in displaying
   information not in any mathematical operations.  Something like
   keyLen or ptLen values would be better used without quotes to avoid
   having to convert the string to an integer for use in the code.

Appendix B.  Error Messages

   General or registration errors detected by the server SHALL result in
   an HTML error and description of the problem, for example:

    HTTP response: 400

    "error" : "Incorrectly formatted JSON (51:18): expected field name was not provided: inBit"


   Errors detected by the client SHOULD trigger an indication of the
   operation that failed and a detailed error description.  This
   information can be sent to the clients local logging facility to
   provide traceability of communication issues, for example:



         ACV Operation: SHA-512
         Error: Unsupported hash algorithm
