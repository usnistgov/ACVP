1.  Introduction

   The Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a
   mechanism to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of
   a software or hardware cryptographic module.  The intention of the
   protocol is to minimize human involvement in the testing of
   cryptography.  The ACVP specification defines how a cryptographic
   module communicates with an ACVP server, including cryptographic
   capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication, vector
   processing and more.  Note that the ACVP specification does not
   define algorithm-specific JSON constructs for performing the
   cryptographic validation.  However, a series of ACVP sub-
   specifications defines the constructs for testing individual
   cryptographic algorithms.  Each sub-specification addresses a
   specific class or subset of cryptographic algorithms.  This sub-
   specification defines the JSON constructs for testing symmetric block
   cipher cryptographic algorithms using ACVP.  The ACVP server performs
   a set of tests on the block ciphers in order to assess the
   correctness and robustness of the implementation.  A typical ACVP
   validation session would require multiple tests to be performed for
   every supported cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-ECB, AES-CBC,
   AES-CTR, AES-GCM, TDES-CBC, TDES-CTR, etc.

3.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of block cipher algorithms.  There are three types of
   tests for block ciphers: functional tests, Monte Carlo tests and
   counter tests.  Each has a specific value to be used in the testType
   field.  The testType field definitions are:

   o  "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  These tests can be processed
      by the client using a normal 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' operation.
      AFTs cause the implementation under test to exercise normal
      operations on a single block, multiple blocks, or (where
      applicable) partial blocks.  In some cases random data is used, in
      others, static, predetermined tests are provided.  The functional
      tests of the block cipher are designed to verify that the logical
      components of the cipher (GFSbox, KeySbox, block chaining etc.)
      are operating correctly.

   o  "MCT" - Monte Carlo Test.  These tests exercise the implementation
      under test under strenuous circumstances.  The implementation
      under test must process the test vectors according to the correct
      algorithm and mode in this document.  MCTs can help detect
      potential memory leaks over time, and problems in allocation of
      resources, addressing variables, error handling and generally
      improper behavior in response to random inputs.  Each MCT
      processes 100 pseudorandom tests.  Not every algorithm and mode
      combination has an MCT.  See Section 3.1 for implementation
      details.

   o  "CTR" - Counter Mode Test.  Counter tests are specifically for
      counter modes (AES-CTR and TDES-CTR) and require an implementation
      under test to exercise their counter mechanism.  The server will
      send a long message to the client for encryption or decryption and
      back-compute the IVs used by the implementation under test.  These
      IVs are then verified for uniqueness and an increasing (or
      decreasing) nature.  The client processes these tests as normal
      AFTs.  The different mode is highlighted here to signify the
      difference on the server side for processing.

3.1.  Monte Carlo tests for block ciphers

   The MCTs start with an initial condition (plaintext/ciphertext, key,
   and optional, or maybe multiple IVs) and perform a series of chained
   computations.  For modes that use an IV, the IV is used in the
   beginning of each pseudorandom process.  There are separate rounds of
   MCT for encryption and decryption.  Because some block cipher modes
   rely on an IV and perform calculations differently from other modes,
   there are specific definitions of MCT for many of the block cipher
   modes.

   Note: For all the following, the pseudocode for decryption can be
   obtained by replacing all PT's with CT's and all CT's with PT's.  As
   well, replace the encrypt operation with the corresponding decrypt
   operation.

3.1.1.  AES Monte Carlo Test - ECB mode

   The initial condition for the test is the tuple (KEY, PT) set to some
   values.

   The algorithm is shown in Figure 1 .

   Most AES MCTs use a shared key shuffle routine.  The algorithm is

   (KEY, CT) set to some values.  This pseudocode is specifically for
   encryption.  For decryption, swap all instances of CT with PT.

3.2.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [FIPS-197] and [SP800-38A] .

3.2.1.  AES Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-38A], both Section 5 and Section 6 which describe general
   modes of operation for block ciphers are tested.  In [FIPS-197],
   Section 4 outlines the AES engine and necessary functions to perform
   simple encrypt an decrypt operations.  All AES tests perform such
   operations and thus rely heavily on this section.  Section 5
   specifically outlines the algorithm for AES and thus all AES tests
   rely heavily on this section as well.  All of [SP800-38A-Add]

   requirements are covered.  In [AES-XTS], the IEEE outlines the
   encrypt and decrypt operations for AES-XTS.

3.2.2.  AES Requirements Not Covered

   Some requirements in the outlined specifications are not easily
   tested.  Often they are not ideal for black-box testing such as the
   ACVP.  In [SP800-38A], Appendix A outlines padding for when the data
   being encrypted does not evenly fill the blocks.  In these tests, all
   data, unless otherwise specified, is assumed to be a multiple of the
   block length.  All exceptions to those cases are when stream ciphers
   specifically are being tested.  In Section 5.3, IV generation which
   is required for all modes of AES and TDES outside of ECB, is not
   tested.  Appendix D outlines how errors are to be handled.  As some
   symmetric ciphers aren't authenticated, ACVP does not include tests
   that change random bits in payload, IV, key or results, as these
   results can be successfully encrypted/decrypted, but errors aren't
   necessarily detectable.  In [FIPS-197], Section 5.3 defines the
   inverse cipher for AES.  This is not tested in the CBC, CFB (all),
   OFB or CTR modes.  In [SP800-38E], the AES-XTS algorithm is
   restricted to 2^20 AES blocks (128-bits each) per key.  Due to the
   size of the data, ACVP does not test the proper usage of a key over
   such large amounts of data.

3.2.3.  TDES Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-67r2], Section 3 outlines the use for TDES with keying
   option 1 (three distinct keys) and decryption only for keying option
   2 (K1 == K3 != K2).  Depending on the cipher mode, both the forward
   and inverse cipher are tested.  The known answer tests address these
   requirements.

3.2.4.  TDES Requirements Not Covered

   In [SP800-67r2], Section 3.3 outlines requirements for keys for
   proper usage of TDES.  These requirements are not tested by ACVP.
   All keys used in the tests are randomly or staticly generated by the
   server.  There are no checks for key equality or potentially weak
   keys.  Section 3.3.2 outlines specific keys which are to be avoided.
   ACVP does not expect a client to be able to detect these keys.

3.2.5.  AEAD Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-38D], Section 7 outlines the encrypt and decrypt operations
   for AES-GCM.  This and all prerequisites to these operations (such as

   [SP800-38C], Section 6 outlines the encrypt and decrypt operations
   for AES-CCM.  This and all prerequisites to these operations (such as

   CBC-MAC) are tested as AES-CCM encrypt and decrypt operations.  In
   [AES-GCM-SIV], the draft outlines the encrypt and decrypt operations
   for AES-GCM-SIV.

3.2.6.  AEAD Requirements Not Covered

   In [SP800-38D], Section 8 outlines uniqueness requirements on IVs and
   keys for AES-GCM.  This is considered out of bounds for the algorithm
   testing done by the ACVP and will not be tested.

3.2.7.  KeyWrap Requirements Covered

   In [SP800-38F] Section 5.2 defines the authenticated encryption and
   authenticated decryption operations for all three key-wrap
   algorithms.  As well, the padding for key-wrap with padding is
   defined.  Algorithm Functional Tests provide assurance of these
   requirements for encrypt operations.  For decrypt operations, there
   is a possibility to reject the ciphertext due to improper wrapping.
   This is also assured by the Algorithm Functional Tests.  Sections 6
   and 7 outline the specific ciphers in both encrypt and decrypt
   directions.  All facsets of these processes are tested with random
   data via the Algorithm Functional Tests.

3.2.8.  KeyWrap Requirements Not Covered

   In [SP800-38F] Section 5.3 defines the length requirements allowed by
   an optimal implementation.  The upper bounds are unreasonably large
   to test in a web-based model and thus an artificial maximum is
   selected for the payloadLen property (corresponding to both plaintext
   and ciphertext).  The Algorithm Functional Tests SHOULD utilize both
   the minimum and maximum values provided in the client's registration
   optimally with other values.

3.2.9.  Format-Preserving Encryption Requirements Covered

   All of [SP800-38Gr1] requirements are covered.

4.  Capabilities Registration

   This section describes the constructs for advertising support of
   block cipher algorithms to the ACVP server.  ACVP REQURIES
   cryptographic modules to register their capabilities in a
   registration.  This allows the cryptographic module to advertise

   support for specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which
   algorithms need test vectors generated for the validation process.

   The block cipher algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON
   objects within the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration
   message.  The 'algorithms' value MUST be an array, where each array
   element is an individual JSON object defined in this section.  The
   'algorithms' value MUST be part of the 'capability_exchange' element
   of the ACVP JSON registration message.  See the ACVP Protocol
   Specification Section XXX for details on the registration message.
   Each block cipher algorithm capability advertised SHALL be a self-
   contained JSON object.

4.1.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for Block Cipher Validations

   Some block cipher algorithm implementations rely on other
   cryptographic primitives.  For example, AES-CCM uses an underlying
   AES-ECB algorithm.  Each of these underlying algorithm primitives
   MUST be validated, either separately or as part of the same
   submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required
   prerequisites:

4.2.  Block Cipher Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

   Each algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON object
   and SHALL use the following values when appropriate:

   Note: Some optional values are required depending on the algorithm.
   For example, AES-GCM requires ivLen, ivGen, ivGenMode, aadLen and
   tagLen.  Failure to provide these values will result in the ACVP
   server returning an error to the ACVP client during registration.

   The following grid outlines which properties are REQUIRED, as well as
   all the possible values a server MAY support for each standard block

5.  Test Vectors

   After receiving a valid registration of a cryptographic module, the
   ACVP server SHALL provide test vectors in the form of a prompt to the
   ACVP client, which then SHALL be processed and returned to the ACVP
   server for validation.  A typical ACVP validation session would
   require the client to download and process multiple test vector sets.
   Each test vector set SHALL represent an individual cryptographic
   algorithm, such as AES-ECB, AES-CBC, TDES-CTR, etc.  This section
   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with block
   cipher algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta-data for the entire vector set.  The test vector set

   SHALL be comprised of test groups which SHALL subsequently contain
   individual test cases to be processed by the ACVP client.  The
   following table describes the REQUIRED JSON elements at the top level
   of the hierarchy:

5.1.  Test Groups

   Test vector sets MUST contain one or many test groups, each sharing
   similar properties.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same
   key size would be grouped together.  The testGroups element at the
   top level of the test vector JSON object SHALL be the array of test
   groups.  The Test Group JSON object MUST contain meta-data that
   applies to all test cases within the group.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements that MAY appear from the server in the
   Test Group JSON object:

                      Table 9: Test Group JSON Object

   Some properties MUST appear in the prompt file from the server for
   every testGroup object.  They are as follows:

   o  tgId

   o  direction

   o  testType

   o  tests

   The other properties MAY appear depending on the algorithm selected
   for the test vector set.  The following grid defines the REQUIRED
   properties for each standard block cipher, as well as the valid

   Table 11: Prompt Test Group Authenticated Block Cipher Applicability

   Note: The particular values of a domain are REQUIRED to be an integer
   element of the domain present in the registration used.  The ACVP
   server MAY select predetermined or random values with particular
   features (ex. on a block boundary, or not on a block boundary) within
   the domain the client provided in the registration.  Note: For AES-
   GCM-SIV, as the 'ivLen' and 'tagLen' are static values, their values
   are included in the table as for completeness.  They MAY NOT appear
   within the prompt from the server.  Due to their static nature, they
   can safely be assumed from the algorithm.

   The following grid defines when each property is REQUIRED from a
   server for a key-wrap block cipher:

   Table 13: Prompt Test Group Miscellaneous Block Cipher Applicability
                                   Grid

   Note: The particular values of a domain are REQUIRED to be an integer
   element of the domain present in the registration used.  The ACVP
   server MAY select predetermined or random values with particular
   features (ex. on a block boundary, or not on a block boundary) within
   the domain the client provided in the registration.

5.2.  Test Cases

   Each test group SHALL contain an array of one or more test cases.
   Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single case to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each test case.

                      Table 14: Test Case JSON Object

   Note: The applicability of each test case property is dependent on
   the test group and test vector (algorithm) properties.  Each test
   type within the test group requires specific operations to be
   performed and thus specific data returned to the server.  Consult
   Section 3 for more information.  The tcId property MUST appear within
   every test case sent to and from the server.

6.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it SHALL
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server within the alloted
   timeframe.  The following table describes the JSON object that
   represents a vector set response.

   +------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+
   | JSON Value | Description                          | JSON type     |
   +------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+

   | vsId       | Unique numeric identifier for the    | integer       |
   |            | vector set                           |               |
   | testGroups | Array of JSON objects that represent | array of      |
   |            | each test vector group. See Table 16 | testGroup     |
   |            |                                      | objects       |
   +------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+

                 Table 15: Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroup Response section is used to organize the ACVP client
   response in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several
   algorithms SHALL require the client to send back group level
   properties in its response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

   +---------+------------------------------------+--------------------+
   | JSON    | Description                        | JSON type          |
   | Value   |                                    |                    |

              Table 16: Vector Set Group Response JSON Object

   Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single test object
   to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes
   the JSON elements for each test case object.

Appendix B.  Example Vector Set Request/Responses JSON Object

   The following sections provide examples of the JSON objects for each
   of the AES algorithms.  Examples will reflect what testTypes are
   supported by each algorithm, ie AFT, MCT or counter.  MCT examples
   have only 2 iterations shown for brevity.
