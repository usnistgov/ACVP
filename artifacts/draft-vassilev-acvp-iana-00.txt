1.  Introduction

   The Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) [acvp] defines
   a mechanism to automatically validate the cryptographic algorithm
   implementations of software or hardware cryptographic modules.  The
   ACVP specification defines how a cryptographic module communicates
   with a validation authority server, including cryptographic
   capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication, test
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm-specific JSON constructs for performing the cryptographic
   validation.  A series of ACVP-related sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual cryptographic algorithms, see for
   example [sub-symmetric].  Each such sub-specification addresses a
   specific algorithm or a class of cryptographic algorithms.  This
   document defines the IANA registry for the supported algorithm test
   specifications that work with ACVP.  The registry defined here
   provides the binding between the protocol and the supported algorithm
   test extensions.

2.  IANA namespaces

   There are three namespaces envisioned for extensions to the ACVP:

   o  ACVP - the approved algorithms for testing with one or more
      validation authorities

   o  EXPERIMENTAL - candidate algorithms for approval.

   o  LOCAL - locally supported algorithms, not guaranteed for
      interoperability.  Algorithms in this namespace cannot be
      registered with IANA.

   TBD

3.  Algorithm registry

   Each entry in the algorithm registry must record the following
   fields:

   o  Name: a URN segment that conforms to the pattern
      {namespace}-{algorithm}. The keywords are defined as follows:

      *  {namespace}: one of the options from Section 2.

      *  {algorithm}: a required US-ASCII string that conforms to the
         URN syntax requirements (see [RFC8141]).  This string must be
         unique within the corresponding namespace.

   o  Revision: the revision identifier for the test specification of a
      particular algorithm.  A required US-ASCII string that conforms to
      the URN syntax requirements (see [RFC8141]).

   o  Reference: A static link to the specification and section where
      the definition of the parameter can be found.

6.1.  ACVP URN Sub-namespace

   IANA should add an entry to the "IETF URN Sub-namespace for
   Registered Protocol Parameter Identifiers" registry located at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/params/ as per [RFC3553].

   The entry should be as follows:

      Registered Parameter Identifier: ACVP

      Specification: this document

      Repository: ACVP URN Parameters (see Section 6.2)

6.2.  ACVP URN Parameters

   A new top-level registry should be created, titled "Automated
   Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) URN Parameters".

   Registration in the "ACVP URN Parameters" registry is via the
   Specification Required policy [RFC8126].  Registration requests must
   be sent to both the ACVP Working Group mailing list (acvp@ietf.org)
   and IANA.  IANA will forward registration requests to the Designated
   Expert.

   Each entry in this subregistry must record the following fields:

      Name: A required US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN syntax
      requirements (see [RFC8141]).  This string MUST be constructed
      according to the specification in Section 3.  Note: entries from
      the namespace "LOCAL" SHALL be forbidden from this table.

      Revision: A required US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
      syntax requirements (see [RFC8141]).  The combination
      {Name}-{Revision} for each entry MUST be unique for the entire
      subregistry.

      Reference: A static link to the specification and section where
      the definition of the parameter can be found.

   This repository SHALL have as initial values the entries in Table 1.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are addressed by the ACVP specification.
