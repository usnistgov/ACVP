1.  Introduction

   The Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a
   mechanism to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of
   a software or hardware cryptographic module.  The intention of the
   protocol is to minimize human involvement in the testing of
   cryptography.  The ACVP specification defines how a cryptographic
   module communicates with an ACVP server, including cryptographic
   capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication, vector
   processing and more.  Note that the ACVP specification does not
   define algorithm-specific JSON constructs for performing the
   cryptographic validation.  However, a series of ACVP sub-
   specifications defines the constructs for testing individual
   cryptographic algorithms.  Each sub-specification addresses a
   specific class or subset of cryptographic algorithms.  This sub-
   specification defines the JSON constructs for testing the Extendable
   Output Functions cSHAKE, parallelHash, tupleHash and KMAC algorithms
   using ACVP.  The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the hash
   algorithms in order to assess the correctness and robustness of the
   implementation.  A typical ACVP validation session would require

   multiple tests to be performed for every supported cryptographic
   algorithm.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Supported Algorithms

   The following XOFs may be advertised by this ACVP compliant crypto
   module:

   o  cSHAKE-128

   o  cSHAKE-256

   o  parallelHash-128

   o  parallelHash-256

   o  tupleHash-128

   o  tupleHash-256

   o  KMAC-128

   o  KMAC-256

   Other XOFs may be advertised by the ACVP elsewhere.

3.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of XOFs.  There are three types of tests for these
   algorithms: Algorithm Functional Tests (AFT), Monte Carlo Tests (MCT)
   and MAC Verification Tests (MVT).  Each has a specific value to be
   used in the testType field.  The testType field definitions are:

   o  "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  XXX

   o  "MCT" - Monte Carlo Test.  XXX See Section 3.1 for implementation
      details.

   o  "MVT" - MAC Verification Test.  XXX

4.  Capabilities Registration

   This section describes the constructs for advertising support of XOFs
   to the ACVP server.  ACVP REQUIRES cryptographic modules to register
   their capabilities in a registration.  This allows the cryptographic
   module to advertise support for specific algorithms, notifying the
   ACVP server which algorithms need test vectors generated for the
   validation process.

   The XOF capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value MUST be an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value MUST be part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP
   JSON registration message.  See the ACVP Protocol Specification
   Section XXX for details on the registration message.  Each XOF
   algorithm capability advertised SHALL be a self-contained JSON
   object.

   Each algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON object.
   The following JSON values are used for hash algorithm capabilities:

5.  Test Vectors

   After receiving a valid registration of a cryptographic module, the
   ACVP server SHALL provide test vectors in the form of a prompt to the
   ACVP client, which then SHALL be processed and returned to the ACVP
   server for validation.  A typical ACVP validation session would
   require the client to download and process multiple test vector sets.
   Each test vector set SHALL represent an individual cryptographic
   algorithm, such as KMAC-256, TupleHash-128, or cSHAKE-128.  This
   section describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with XOF
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta-data for the entire vector set.  The test vector set
   SHALL be comprised of test groups which SHALL subsequently contain
   individual test cases to be processed by the ACVP client.  The
   following table describes the REQUIRED JSON elements at the top level
   of the hierarchy:

   +------------+----------------------------------------+-------------+
   | JSON Value | Description                            | JSON type   |

   |            | which are defined in Section 5.1       | testGroup   |

5.1.  Test Groups

   Test vector sets MUST contain one or many test groups, each sharing
   similar properties.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same
   key size would be grouped together.  The testGroups element at the
   top level of the test vector JSON object SHALL be the array of test
   groups.  The Test Group JSON object MUST contain meta-data that
   applies to all test cases within the group.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements that MUST appear from the server in the
   Test Group JSON object:

   Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single case to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each test case.

5.3.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it SHALL
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server within the alloted
   timeframe.  The following table describes the JSON object that
   represents a vector set response.

                 Table 6: Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroup Response section is used to organize the ACVP client
   response in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several
   algorithms SHALL require the client to send back group level
   properties in its response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

              Table 7: Vector Set Group Response JSON Object

   Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single test object
   to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes
   the JSON elements for each test case object.
