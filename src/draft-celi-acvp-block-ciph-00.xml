        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                The Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism to automatically
                verify the cryptographic implementation of a software or hardware cryptographic module. The intention of the protocol
                is to minimize human involvement in the testing of cryptography.
                The ACVP specification defines how a cryptographic module communicates with an ACVP
                server, including cryptographic capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
                vector processing and more. Note that the ACVP specification does not define algorithm-specific
                JSON constructs for performing the cryptographic validation. However, a series of ACVP sub-specifications
                defines the constructs for testing individual cryptographic algorithms. Each sub-specification
                addresses a specific class or subset of cryptographic algorithms. This sub-specification defines the JSON
                constructs for testing symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithms using ACVP.  The ACVP server performs a set
                of tests on the block ciphers in order to assess the correctness and robustness of the
                implementation. A typical ACVP validation session would require multiple tests to be performed for every supported
                cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-ECB, AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM, TDES-CBC, TDES-CTR, etc.

            <t>
                This section describes the design of the tests used to validate implementations of block cipher algorithms.
                There are three types of tests for block ciphers: functional tests, Monte Carlo tests and counter tests. Each has a specific value to be used in the
                testType field.  The testType field definitions are:

                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                        "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test. These tests can be processed by the client using a normal 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' operation.
                        AFTs cause the implementation under test to exercise normal operations on a single block, multiple blocks, or (where applicable)
                        partial blocks. In some cases random data is used, in others, static, predetermined tests are provided. The functional tests of the
                        block cipher are designed to verify that the logical components of the cipher (GFSbox, KeySbox, block chaining etc.) are operating correctly.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        "MCT" - Monte Carlo Test. These tests exercise the implementation under test under strenuous circumstances. The implementation
                        under test must process the test vectors according to the correct algorithm and mode in this document. MCTs can help detect
                        potential memory leaks over time, and problems in allocation of resources, addressing variables, error handling and generally improper behavior in
                        response to random inputs. Each MCT processes 100 pseudorandom tests. Not every algorithm and mode combination has an MCT.
                        See
                        <xref target="MC_test"/>
                        for implementation details.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        "CTR" - Counter Mode Test. Counter tests are specifically for counter modes (AES-CTR and TDES-CTR) and require an implementation under test to
                        exercise their counter mechanism. The server will send a long message to the client for encryption or decryption and back-compute
                        the IVs used by the implementation under test. These IVs are then verified for uniqueness and an increasing (or decreasing)
                        nature. The client processes these tests as normal AFTs. The different mode is highlighted here to signify the difference on the server side for
                        processing.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <section anchor="MC_test" title="Monte Carlo tests for block ciphers">
                <t>
                    The MCTs start with an initial condition (plaintext/ciphertext, key, and optional, or maybe multiple IVs) and perform a series of chained computations. For modes
                    that use an IV, the IV is used in the beginning of each pseudorandom process. There are separate rounds of MCT for encryption and decryption. Because some
                    block cipher modes rely on an IV and perform calculations differently from other modes, there are specific definitions of MCT for many of the block cipher modes.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Note: For all the following, the pseudocode for decryption can be obtained by replacing all
                    PT's with CT's and all CT's with PT's. As well, replace the encrypt operation with the corresponding decrypt operation.

                        the algorithm for AES and thus all AES tests rely heavily on this section as well.

                        Some requirements in the outlined specifications are not easily tested. Often they are not ideal for black-box testing such as the ACVP.
                        
                        In <xref target="SP800-38A"/>, Appendix A outlines padding for when the data being encrypted does not evenly fill the blocks. In these tests,
                        all data, unless otherwise specified, is assumed to be a multiple of the block length. All exceptions to those cases are when stream ciphers
                        specifically are being tested. In Section 5.3, IV generation which is required for all modes of AES and TDES outside of ECB, is not tested.
                        Appendix D outlines how errors are to be handled. As some symmetric ciphers aren't authenticated, ACVP does not include tests that change
                        random bits in payload, IV, key or results, as these results can be successfully encrypted/decrypted, but errors aren't necessarily detectable.

                        In <xref target="FIPS-197"/>, Section 5.3 defines the inverse cipher for AES. This is not tested in the CBC, CFB (all), OFB or CTR modes.

                        In <xref target="SP800-38E"/>, the AES-XTS algorithm is restricted to 2^20 AES blocks (128-bits each) per key. Due to the size of the data,
                        ACVP does not test the proper usage of a key over such large amounts of data.

                        All keys used in the tests are randomly or staticly generated by the server. There are no checks for key equality or potentially weak keys. Section 
                        3.3.2 outlines specific keys which are to be avoided. ACVP does not expect a client to be able to detect these keys.

                This section describes the constructs for advertising support of block cipher algorithms to the
                ACVP server. ACVP REQURIES cryptographic modules to register their capabilities in a registration.
                This allows the cryptographic module to advertise support for specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which
                algorithms need test vectors generated for the validation process.
            </t>

            <t>
                The block cipher algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within the 'algorithms'
                value of the ACVP registration message. The 'algorithms' value MUST be an array, where each
                array element is an individual JSON object defined in this section. The 'algorithms'
                value MUST be part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON registration message.
                See the ACVP Protocol Specification Section XXX for details on the registration message.

                Each block cipher algorithm capability advertised SHALL be a self-contained JSON object.

                After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it SHALL send the response vectors
                back to the ACVP server within the alloted timeframe. The following table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set response.

                level properties in its response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

            <t>The following is a example JSON object for test results sent from the crypto module to the ACVP server for an TDES-ECB Monte Carlo test, only 2 iterations shown for brevity. For MCT results of each iteration are fed into the next iteration.  Therefore the results carry all fields to assist in any failure diagnosis.</t>
