=== Conditioning Component Algorithm Capabilities Registration

This section describes the constructs for advertising support of conditioning component algorithms to the ACVP server.

==== Block Cipher Based Conditioning Component Capabilities

The following ConditioningComponent / AES-CBC-MAC / SP800-90B and ConditioningComponent / BlockCipher_DF / SP800-90B capabilities *MAY* be advertised by the ACVP compliant crypto module:

[[caps_table]]
.Block Cipher Conditioning Component Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values
|===
| JSON Value | Description | JSON type | Valid Values

| algorithm | The algorithm to be validated | string | "ConditioningComponent"
| mode | The specific conditioning component to be validated | string | "AES-CBC-MAC" or "BlockCipher_DF"
| revision | The algorithm testing revision to use | string | "SP800-90B"
| keyLen | The length of keys supported in bits | array | [128, 192, 256]
| keys | User-defined keys used to generate, AES-CBC-MAC only | array | Must have matching keyLen support
| payloadLen | The lengths in bits supported by the IUT | domain | [{"min": 8, "max": 65536, "inc": 8}]
| outputLen | The lengths in bits supported by the IUT as output only for BlockCipher_DF | domain | [{"min": 128, "max": 512, "inc": 8}]
|===

NOTE: For ConditioningComponent / AES-CBC-MAC / SP800-90B, the payload itself is processed through the encryption engine. Therefore the minimum 'payloadLen' is 128 bits and the minimum increment is 128 bits. In other words, all values within the 'payloadLen' must correspond to complete AES blocks in bits (a multiple of 128).

NOTE: For ConditioningComponent / AES-CBC-MAC / SP800-90B, 'keys' must have a matching supported 'keyLen', i.e., if submitting a key of 128-bits, 'keyLen' must have 128 supported as well. The opposite is true as well, every kenLen must include a matching Key. When user-defined keys are utilized, random keys will not be generated.

The following is an example of a registration for ConditioningComponents / AES-CBC-MAC / SP800-90B
