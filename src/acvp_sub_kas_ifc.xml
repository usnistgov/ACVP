            <t>The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism to automatically
                verify the cryptographic implementation of a software or hardware crypto module. The
                ACVP specification defines how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server,
                including crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
                vector processing and more. The ACVP specification does not define algorithm
                specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto validation. A series of ACVP
                sub-specifications define the constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.
                Each sub-specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms. This
                sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing KAS IFC algorithms using
                ACVP.</t>

            <t>
                The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the KAS protocol in order to assess the
                correctness and robustness of the implementation. A typical ACVP validation session
                SHALL require multiple tests to be performed for every supported permutation of KAS
                capabilities. This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
                implementations of KAS algorithms. There are two test types for KAS testing:
                <list style="testtype">
                    <t>"AFT" - Algorithm Function Test. In the AFT test mode, the IUT SHALL 
                        act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server. The server SHALL
                        generate and provide all necessary information for the IUT to perform a
                        successful key agreement; both the server and IUT MAY act as party U/V, as
                        well as recipient/provider to key confirmation.</t>
                    <t>"VAL" - Validation test. In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server MUST generate a
                        complete (from both party U and party V's perspectives) key agreement, and
                        expects the IUT to be able to determine if that agreement is valid. Various
                        types of errors MSUT be introduced in varying portions of the key agreement
                        process (changed DKM, changed key, changed hash digest, etc), that the IUT 
                        MUST be able to detect and report on.</t>

            <t>ACVP REQUIRES crypto modules to register their capabilities. This allows the crypto
                module to advertise support for specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which
                algorithms need test vectors generated for the validation process. This section
                describes the constructs for advertising support of KAS IFC algorithms to the ACVP
                server.</t>
            <t>The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the 'algorithms'
                value of the ACVP registration message. The 'algorithms' value is an array, where
                each array element is an individual JSON object defined in this section. The
                'algorithms' value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
                registration message. See the ACVP specification for details on the registration
                message. Each KDF algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON

            <t>The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are then processed
                    and returned to the ACVP server for validation. A typical ACVP validation session
                    would require multiple test vector sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP
                    client. Each test vector set represents an individual KAS ECC function. This section
                    describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with KAS ECC algorithms.</t>
            <t>The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that contains meta data
                    for the entire vector set as well as individual test vectors to be processed by the
                    ACVP client.The following table describes the JSON elements at the top level of the

                    send back group level properties in their response. This structure helps accommodate

            <t>The testCase section is used to organize the ACVP client response in a similar

                        send back group level properties in their response. This structure helps accommodate
                        that.</t>
