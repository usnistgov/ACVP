   <abstract>
     <t>This document defines the Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol(ACVP).</t>
   </abstract>
 </front>

 <middle>
   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>ACVP enables communication between a cryptographic module that is embedded inside of a device or otherwise running on a platform accessible via computer network, and an external testing system, using standard network communication interfaces and protocols.  This communication protocol can also be used to validate the correctness of the implementations of the algorithms in the cryptographic module with a validation authority.
This document describes how ACVP is structured with respect to the client-server model, the messaging protocol, optional features and flows.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
     </section>
   </section>

   <section anchor="caps_reg" title="Overview">
	    <t>ACVP has the following goals:</t>
	    <t><list style="symbols">
<t>	To work in situations where the testing system is remote from the cryptographic module, e.g. running as a process on a separate device.</t>
<t>	To enable automated testing that can take place with a minimum of human interaction.</t>
<t>	To enable the testing system to discover the capabilities of the module being tested; that is, the particular algorithms and parameters that the module supports.</t>
<t>	To provide extensibility that can be used to introduce tests for new algorithms, and new tests for existing algorithms.</t>
<t>	To be compatible with emerging automated validation systems wherever possible, especially the FIPS-140 Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program.</t>
<t>	To provide a standard communication method so that vendors can utilize the same testing service for FIPS-140, 3rd party crypto verification and product FCS readiness testing.</t>
	   </list></t>

<t>ACVP defines how to communicate a request (to execute a cryptographic operation) to a cryptographic module, and how to communicate the corresponding response (containing the output of that operation) back to a testing system.  It defines a transport (based on HTTP or HTTPS), an encoding and message format (which is negotiated), and a set of message exchanges.  Each vector test set corresponds to a single message exchange driven from the client associated with the module under test.
ACVP does not define the cryptographic algorithms, nor does it detail the precise conditions for a response to be acceptable.  Instead, it references existing specifications for those algorithms, and defines a mapping between the data on the wire and the algorithm testing specification.
ACVP does not define detailed conformance criteria, such as those in FIPS-140.  Instead, it aims to be independent of particular conformance criteria, so that it can be used in multiple domains with different (even potentially conflicting) conformance criteria.
ACVP does not define an interface that can be used to manage or control a cryptographic module.</t>
        <section title="Audience">
	<t>This document is written to address multiple audiences:</t>
	    <t><list style="symbols">
<t>	Crypto module developers who require validation testing</t>
<t>	Crypto validation organizations who will perform validation testing</t>
<t>	Crypto module customers that desire validation testing results or verifiable artifacts of testing</t>
	   </list></t>
	 </section>

        <section title="Goals">
	<t>The goals for this document are to provide a messaging protocol that can be used with existing authentication and communication protocols to provide a way to test crypto modules.
The following functions are outside the scope of this document:</t>
	    <t><list style="symbols">
<t>	The API to the cryptographic module</t>
<t>	How the KATs are generated</t>
<t>	How the results/artifacts are stored or managed</t>
<t>	Authentication used</t>
<t>	Scalability</t>
<t>	Management interface</t>
	   </list></t>
	 <t>With that in mind there are several expectations when building a server used as a validation authority.  A validation authority shall use HTTPS, TLS 1.2 or greater and mutual authentication. Therefore a client that expects to be used with a validation authority shall have the same requirements.  A server, proxy or client developed for the purposes of internal organizational testing only may chose not to include some of those features.</t>

   <section title="Vector Set Expiration">
       <t>
	   Vector sets can expire.  For example, in terms of a validation authority use, the vector sets are one-time 
	   use only.  Old vector sets can never be reused to obtain a new validation certificate for an algorithm
	   implementation or to update an existing certificate. Expiration is a server specific definition which depends
	   on database costs, need for artifacts, etc. If the vector set has expired, the server will reply with an
	   expired response when the client attempts to download the vector set:

       <t>The ACVP protocol requires server implementations to generate KAT values and retain the data while the ACVP
	   client processes and returns the results.  Some crypto modules implementing the client-side ACVP protocol may
	   not return results immediately.  The ACVP protocol design implies the server must retain the KAT values to
	   verify the client KAT responses at some time in the future.  However, some KAT vector sets are fairly large,
	   which could place significant storage requirements on ACVP server implementations.  To alleviate long term
	   storage requirements, ACVP allows for an expiration timestamp to be set when a KAT vector set is generated
	   by the server. 
       </t>
       <t>The vector set expiration timestamp must be included by the server in the vector set when the client downloads
	   the vector set.  The server may change the expiration timestamp of a previously issued vector set to  
	   extend its lifetime subject to server policy.  The expiration timestamp must be in the 'expiry' 
	   JSON value, which is included in the JSON encoded vector set.  The expiry JSON value will be a string 
	   value of the UTC timestamp using form "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".  The following figure shows a partial JSON 
	   encoded vector set that contains the expiry value.

	<section title="Resending Test Responses">
	    <t>
		When one or more test cases fails, the client will need to correct the issue in the crypto module
		and send the responses again.  The resending of responses for failed test cases will occur for
		an entire vector set.  Therefore, even if only a single test case in the vector set failed, the client
		will need to download, process, and upload responses to the server for the entire vector set
		(presumably after the problem has been corrected in the DUT).  The resending of vector set
		responses must occur prior to expiry.

   <section title="Other Considerations">
   <t>When an ACVP client is attached to a cryptographic module that is in use, access to ACVP MUST be controlled so that only an administrator or other authorized user can send and receive ACVP messages.  This is because an attacker that has access to ACVP can potentially use it to probe for weaknesses in the cryptographic module.</t>

    <section anchor="app-reg-ex" title="JSON Formatting Guidelines">
      <t>All JSON keywords shall use lower camelCase format with no underscores or hyphens
and use the following characters only a-z, A-Z, 0-9. Keywords shall abbreviate common words and
phrases wherever possible for brevity.</t>

<t>For example:

password length - pwLen
plain text length - ptLen
</t>

<t>Keywords should be chosen such that they are informative and brief, for example:
</t>

<t>
{
"acvVersion" : "0.2",
"results" : {
"disposition" : "incomplete",
} 
</t>
<t>Metadata assigned to the keyword may use any format which best reflects the
information being represented including hyphens, underscores alternating
case, numbers, etc. However, brevity should be a major consideration, for example:</t>
<t>
"algorithms" : [
         {
              "algorithm" : "AES-GCM",
              "mode" : "modes",
              "ivGen" : "internal",
              "ivGenMode" : "8.2.1",
         }

All metadata representing strings or big numbers shall use double quotes at both ends. 
Big numbers require conversion from strings to whatever format is used by the DUT.
Numerical values of integer size or with decimal points may use quotations if those
values are generally used as a string, for example the acvVersion would generally be
used in displaying information not in any mathematical operations.  Something like
keyLen or ptLen values would be better used without quotes to avoid having to convert the
string to an integer for use in the code.
