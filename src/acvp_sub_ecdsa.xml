        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a software or hardware crypto module. The ACVP specification defines how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication, vector processing and more. The ACVP specification does not define algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto validation. A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms. Each sub-specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms. This sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing ECDSA algorithms using ACVP.</t>

            <t>The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the specified ECDSA algorithm in order to assess the

                SHALL require multiple tests to be performed for every supported permutation of ECDSA
                capabilities. This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
                implementations of the ECDSA algorithms.
