== Messaging and Workflow

=== Product Registration/Capabilities Exchange

The product registration will utilize the URI resources  <<uriResources>> to register and provide cryptographic capabilities.  This exchange will consist of several message exchanges and will provide a detailed list of cryptographic algorithms and their options to be tested during the testSession, see <<xml_msgFlows>>, retrieval of test vectors, submission of test responses, determining test result, and a certification step to associate the product and tested environment information with the completed test. A set URI resources are also available to retrieve and manage the available metadata such as companay name, primary contact, product descriptions, and operational environment descriptions.

=== Test Exchange

The test exchange consists of the ACV client requesting a particular vectorSet associated with the testSession. The server responds with the vectorSet. The client *MAY* retreive and process the vectorSets in order and *MAY* retreive a vectorSet and immediately return results or request all of the vectorSets and return results at a later time. The client repeats this process until all of the vectorSets in the testSession list have been processed. Once a vectorSet result has been POSTed to the server the client may request success/failure results from the server at any time, however if vectorSets have not been completed the overall status will be incomplete. A minimal message flow is described below <<xml_msgFlows>>.

[[jwtToken]]
=== JSON Web Token (JWT)

JSON Web Token is described in <<RFC7519>> and is used as an authorization mechanism for gaining access to different resources.

[[jwt_example_unsigned]]
.Unsigned JWT
[source,json]
....
{
    "alg" : "none"
}
{
    "iss" : "nist.gov",
    "nbf": 1598293915,
    "exp": 1598295715,
    "iat": 1598293915,
    "pkey" : "cc74f56acdba635079383a03941d68db55c7b3c2f (truncated)"
}
{

}
....


The JWT can be secured if desired using the header encryption "alg" value defined to HS256(HMAC-SHA256) or one of the other secure values. Key agreement would follow RFC7518.

[[jwt_example_signed]]
.Signed JWT
[source,json]
....
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
{
  "iss" : "nist.gov",
  "nbf": 1598293915,
  "exp": 1598295715,
  "iat": 1598293915,
  "pkey" : "cc74f56acdba635079383a03941d68db55c7b3c2f (truncated)"
}
{
    "{signature}"
}
....

where "{signature}" is made up of:

....
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
....

and where "HMACSHA256" is the algorithm specified in the JWT header.

The first four claims are required, however "pkey" is an optional private claim used to pass the key used for encrypting the database at the server. Enabling this option is discussed further in <<testSessions_post>>

[[jwtAuthFlows]]
==== Authorization flows with JWT

JSON Web Token is described in <<RFC7519>> and is used as an authorization mechanism for gaining access to different resources.

In order to access any resource which requires authorization a client must supply the JWT
as an `Authorization` header value as a `Bearer` token. An example header value is:

[align=center,alt=,type=]
....
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5c (truncated)"

[[jwtExpire]]
==== JWT Expiration/Renewal

The JWT access tokens received from either the /login server endpoint *SHALL* be set to expire after a
pre-defined period. The specific length of the expiration period is out of scope for this specification.
However, the expiration period length impacts both the security and protocol overhead. Longer expiration
periods reduce the overhead but increase the window for attacks. Attempting to access a service with an
expired JWT *SHALL* result in a "401 Unauthorized" HTTP status code.

A client may renew an expired JWT access token using the mechanism shown in <<xml_figureRenewalFlows>>below.

[[paging]]
=== Paging

Some resource operations require paging in order to avoid returning large amounts of data. Each operation that uses paging will indicate that uses paging and what the value for each element will be within the section describing that operation. All paged responses *MUST* follow the format described in <<paging_response>>. Conversely, clients may navigate pages using the paging parameters described in <<paging_parameters>>. Server implementations *SHOULD* impose limitations on the page size limit based on resource constraints.

[[paging_parameters]]
==== Parameters

A Server *MUST* accept requests without paging parameters. If not all results are returned, the response *MUST*
indicate that not all of the results were provided using the `incomplete` property of a paged response described in <<paging_response>>. The query parameters clients *MUST* use to specify paging are described below:

* *limit* - `number`, the maximum number of entries to return. Server implementations *MUST* allow requests without a provided value, but the default value is a choice for server implementations.
* *offset* - `number`, the offset into the list of entries, *MUST* default to `0` if not provided.

GET /acvp/v1/vendors?offset=20&limit=20 HTTP/1.1

[[paging_response]]
==== Response

A paged response has the following properties:

* *totalCount* - `number`, the total number of resources available to return
* *incomplete* - `boolean`, true if more resources are avaiable than what is returned in the response
* *links* - `object`, links to use when navigating the pages
** *first* - `string`, a link to the first page in the result set
** *next* - `string`, a link to the next page in the result set, `null` if no next page is available
** *prev* - `string`, a link to the previous page in the result set, `null` if no previous page is available
** *last* - `string`, a link to the last page in the result set
* *data* - `array`, contains an array of data appropriate to the resource requested

[align=center,alt=,type=]
....
[
    {"acvVersion": <acvp-version>},
    {
        "totalCount" : 22007,

            "first" : "/acvp/v1/<resource>?offset=0&limit=20",
            "next" : "/acvp/v1/<resource>?offset=20&limit=20",

        },
        "data" : [ <resource response> ]
    }
]

....

[[query_parameters]]
=== Query Parameters

Some of the resource listing operations allow for query parameters to be provided to filter out the returned values. Each resource will list what properties and operations are available but the general format of the query parameter string is consistent across all resources. The format allows for the specification of complex filters with the concept of groups, where all elements in the same group *MUST* be AND'ed together and different groups are OR'ed together. The URL including the parameter values *MUST* conform to <<RFC3986>> and *MUST* use UTF-8 character encoding.

[align=center,alt=,type=]
General format of a query parameter element.

....
<property>[<index>]=<operation>:<value>

....

* *property* - is the property to be specified
* *index* - is an arbitrary group index, elements with same group index are AND'ed together and elements with different indices are OR'ed togther. `index` *MUST* be between 0 and 99 inclusive.
* *operation* - is an operation on a property and a value. Not all operations require a value, and not all properties will permit every operation. Available operations are:
** *eq* - filter based on property equal to the value
** *ne* - filter based on the property not equal to the value
** *gt* - filter based on the property greater than the value
** *ge* - filter based on the property greater than or equal to the value
** *lt* - filter based on the property less than the value
** *le* - filter based on the property less than or equal to the value
** *contains* - filter based on the property containing the value
** *start* - filter based on the property starting with the value
** *end* - filter based on the property ending with the value
* *value* - the value to filter on, it *MAY* be constrained based on the property

[align=center,alt=,type=]
Example 1

....
/resource?property1[0]=eq:foo&property2[0]=eq:foo
&property1[1]=eq:test&property2[1]=ne:bar
....

For the example above the results returned would include resources that have: `property1` equal to `foo` and `property2` equal to `foo` or resources that have `property1` equal to `test` and `property2` not equal to `bar`.

[align=center,alt=,type=]
Example 2 based on <<vendors_get>>.

....
/vendors?name[0]=contains:acme&name[1]=contains:test
....

For the example above the vendor results returned would include resources that have a `name` property value that contains either `acme` or `test`.

[[requests]]
=== Requests

Some resource operations make a request to modify or create data. To facilitate an out-of-band approval step, where data can be inspected to insure it meets the business requirements of the validation authority which operates the server, the operations will return a `request` url that can be used to obtain information about the status and disposition of the requested modification. Whether or how an authority implements an approval step is outside the scope of this specification.

A request resource is not externally updateable, but *SHOULD* update based on server processing. The properties for a request response:

* *url* - `string`, identifier for this resource
* *status* - `string`, one of:
** *initial* - initial state of the request, created
** *processing* - server is processing the request
** *approved* - the requested operation was successfully processed
** *rejected* - the requested operation was rejected and no change was made
* *message* - `string`, a placeholder for any message describing a rejection
* *approvedUrl* - `string`, a link to the resource which was created or modified as a result of the requested operation

[[requests_get]]
==== Request Listing

*GET /requests*

Returns a paged listing of requests for the current user. Each element in the `data` array is a `request object` as described in <<request_get>>. See also <<paging_response>> for a description of a paged response.

[[request_get]]
==== Request Information

[[vectorSet_results_get]]
==== Request Validation Results

*GET /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/results*

Request Validation Results for a Vector Set.

When `showExpected` was set to true from a POST/PUT under <<vectorSet_results_post>>, additional information is provided back to the client for any failing test cases.  The additional information includes an "expected" as well as "provided" object that *MAY* be useful in diagnosing issues within the vector set validation.

===== Response

The client will send this request to learn the validation results for an individual vector set. Properties are:

* *vsId* - `number`
* *disposition* - `string`, the overall result for the vector set with:
** `fail` - indicates at least one test case has failed.
** `unreceived` - indicates the server has not received responses from the client for all the test cases.
** `incomplete` - indicates not all tests have been processed by the server, however none have failed thus far.
** `expired` - indicates not all the test case responses were received from the client prior to expiry.
** `passed` - indicates all test cases have been processed by the server and have passed.
* *tests* - array of test result objects
** *tcId* - `number`
** *result* - `string`, the result for a test case with:
*** `fail` - indicates the test case has failed.
*** `unreceived` - indicates the server has not received a response from the client for the test case.
*** `incomplete` - indicates the server has not processed the test case.
*** `expired` - indicates the client did not send the test case response to the server prior to expiry.
*** `passed` - indicates the test case passed.
** *reason* - `string`, provides additional detail in case of a `failed` `result` value.
** *expected* - `object`, provides the value(s) the server expected for the test case.
** *provided* - `object`, provides the value(s) the client provided for the test case.

....

[[vectorSet_results_post]]
==== Submit Results

*POST /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/results*

Initial Submission of Vector Set Test Results.

===== Request

The client will send this request to submit the test results for an individual vector set. Similar to the vector set download the format will vary depending on the specific sub-specification of the algorithm and testType being tested.

[source,json]
....
[
  {"acvVersion": "{acvp-version}"},
  {
    "vsId": 1437,
    "revision": "1.0.0",
    "showExpected": true,
    "testGroups": [{
      "tgId": 1,
      "tests": [{
          "tcId": 12340,
          "testCaseProperty1": "ABCD",
          "testCaseProperty2": "1234"
        },
        {
          "tcId": 12341,
          "testCaseProperty1": "5678",
          "testCaseProperty2": "FEDC"
        }, ...
      ]
    }, ...
    ]
  }
]
....

The `showExpected` property is optional; when included (and set to true) the ACVP server will include additional information within the validation response file described in <<vectorSet_results_get>>.

===== Response

No content response. Standard HTTP status codes will indicate success or failure of the submission, but do not indicated the disposition of the tests.

[[vectorSet_results_put]]
==== Update Results Submission

*PUT /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/results*

Update Vector Set Test Results Submission.

When one or more test cases fails, the client will need to correct the issue in the crypto module and send the responses again. The resending of responses for failed test cases will occur for an entire vector set. Therefore, even if only a single test case in the vector set failed, the client will need to download, process, and upload responses to the server for the entire vector set (presumably after the problem has been corrected in the implementation). The resending of vector set responses *MUST* occur prior to expiry.

===== Request

The request content is identical to the request content described in <<vectorSet_results_post>>.

[[vectorSet_expected_get]]
==== Retrieve Expected Results

*GET /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/expected*

Expected Test Results. Expected test results *SHALL* be generated by the server if the isSample test session resource equals true. See <<testSessions>>.

===== Response

The response is identical to the request content described in <<vectorSet_results_post>>.
