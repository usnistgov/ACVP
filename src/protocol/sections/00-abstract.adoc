== Abstract

The ACV Protocol provides a method for communication between a cryptographic module that is embedded inside of a device or otherwise running on a platform accessible via computer network, and an external testing system, using standard network communication interfaces and protocols. This communication protocol can also be used to validate the correctness of the algorithm implementations in the cryptographic module with a validation authority.
