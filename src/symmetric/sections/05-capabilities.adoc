=== Required Prerequisite Algorithms for Block Cipher Validations

Some block cipher algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic primitives. For example, AES-CCM uses an underlying AES-ECB algorithm. Each of these underlying algorithm primitives *MUST* be validated, either separately or as part of the same submission. ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

[cols="<,<,<,<"]
[[prereqs_table]]
.Required Prerequisite Algorithms JSON Values

|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type| Example Values

| algorithm| a prerequisite algorithm| string| AES, DRBG, TDES
| valValue| algorithm validation number| string| actual number or "same" to refer to the same submission
| prereqAlgVal| prerequisite algorithm validation| object| exactly one algorithm property and one valValue property
|===

[[cap_ex]]
=== Block Cipher Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

Each algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON object and *SHALL* use the following values when appropriate:

[cols="<,<,<"]
[[caps_table]]
.Block Cipher Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type

| algorithm| The block cipher algorithm and mode to be validated.| string
| revision| The version of the testing methodology the IUT is requesting to validate against.| string
| conformances| The additional conformance for the algorithm for a specific use-case | array of string
| prereqVals| Prerequisite algorithm validations| array of prereqAlgVal objects described in <<prereqs_table>>
| direction| The IUT processing direction| array of strings
| keyLen| The supported key lengths in bits| array of integers
| payloadLen| The supported plain and cipher text lengths in bits. This varies depending on the algorithm type, for additional details see
<<property_grid_auth>> and <<property_grid_misc>>| domain
| ivLen| The supported IV/Nonce lengths in bits, see <<property_grid_auth>>| domain
| ivGen| IV generation method for AES-GCM/AES-XPN algorithms| string
| ivGenMode| IV generation mode for AES-GCM/AES-XPN algorithms| string
| saltGen| Salt generation method for AES-XPN mode only| string
| aadLen| The supported AAD lengths in bits for AEAD algorithms| domain
| tagLen| The supported Tag lengths in bits for AEAD algorithms, see <<property_grid_auth>>| domain
| kwCipher| The cipher as defined in SP800-38F for key wrap mode| array of strings
| tweakMode| The format of tweak value input for AES-XTS. Hex refers to the tweakValue being a literal hex string. Number refers to the tweakValue being an integer number represented as a hex string.| array of strings
| keyingOption| The Keying Option used in TDES.  Keying option 1 (1) is 3 distinct keys (K1, K2, K3).  Keying Option 2 (2) is 2 distinct keys only suitable for decrypt (K1, K2, K1). | array of integers
| overflowCounter| Indicates if the implementation can handle a counter exceeding the maximum value| boolean
| incrementalCounter| Indicates if the implementation increments the counter (versus decrementing the counter)| boolean
| performCounterTests| Indicates if the implementation can perform the Counter tests which check for an always increasing (or decreasing) counter value| boolean
|===

NOTE: The 'conformances' property is only valid for algorithms listed in <<conformances>>. The valid values in the array are also listed in that section. The array is always optional.

NOTE: Some optional values are required depending on the algorithm. For example, AES-GCM requires ivLen, ivGen, ivGenMode, aadLen and tagLen. Failure to provide these values will result in the ACVP server returning an error to the ACVP client during registration.

NOTE: The 'performCounterTests' option is provided for counter implementations such as linear-feedback shift registers which may not present an always increasing or decreasing counter while still ensuring the IV is unique. This value defaults to true if not present. If it is set to false, the 'overflowCounter' and 'incrementalCounter' values will not be used.

The following grid outlines which properties are *REQUIRED*, as well as all the possible values a server *MAY* support for each standard block cipher algorithm:
