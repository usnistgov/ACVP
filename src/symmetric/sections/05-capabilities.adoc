=== Required Prerequisite Algorithms for Block Cipher Validations

Some block cipher algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic primitives. For example, AES-CCM uses an underlying AES-ECB algorithm. Each of these underlying algorithm primitives *MUST* be validated, either separately or as part of the same submission. ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

[cols="<,<,<,<"]
[[prereqs_table]]
.Required Prerequisite Algorithms JSON Values

|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type| Example Values

| algorithm| a prerequisite algorithm| string| AES, DRBG, TDES
| valValue| algorithm validation number| string| actual number or "same" to refer to the same submission
| prereqAlgVal| prerequisite algorithm validation| object| exactly one algorithm property and one valValue property

[[cap_ex]]
=== Block Cipher Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

Each algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON object and *SHALL* use the following values when appropriate:

[cols="<,<,<"]

.Block Cipher Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values

|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type

| algorithm| The block cipher algorithm and mode to be validated.| string
| revision| The version of the testing methodology the IUT is requesting to validate against.| string

| prereqVals| Prerequisite algorithm validations| array of prereqAlgVal objects described in <<prereqs_table>>
| direction| The IUT processing direction| array of strings
| keyLen| The supported key lengths in bits| array of integers
| payloadLen| The supported plain and cipher text lengths in bits. This varies depending on the algorithm type; for 
additional details see <<property_grid_kw>>, <<property_grid_auth>>, <<property_grid_xts>> and <<property_grid_misc>>. For AES-CTR, the values supplied for this parameter refer to the bit sizes supported in the last incomplete block (less than 128 bits) of the plain or cipher 
text. | domain
| ivLen| The supported IV/Nonce lengths in bits, see <<property_grid_auth>>| domain
| ivGen| IV generation method for AES-GCM/AES-XPN algorithms| string
| ivGenMode| IV generation mode for AES-GCM/AES-XPN algorithms| string
| saltGen| Salt generation method for AES-XPN mode only| string
| aadLen| The supported AAD lengths in bits for AEAD algorithms| domain
| tagLen| The supported Tag lengths in bits for AEAD algorithms, see <<property_grid_auth>>| array of integers
| kwCipher| The cipher as defined in SP800-38F for key wrap mode| array of strings
| tweakMode| Indicates the format(s) of the tweak value input for AES-XTS. A value of "hex" indicates that the IUT expects the tweak value input as a hexadecimal string. A value of "number" indicates that the IUT expects to receive a Data Unit Sequence Number.| array of strings
| keyingOption| The Keying Option used in TDES.  Keying option 1 (1) is 3 distinct keys (K1, K2, K3).  Keying Option 2 (2) is 2 distinct keys only suitable for decrypt (K1, K2, K1). | array of integers
| overflowCounter| Indicates if the implementation can handle a counter exceeding the maximum value| boolean
| incrementalCounter| Indicates if the implementation increments the counter (versus decrementing the counter)| boolean
| performCounterTests| Indicates if the implementation can perform the Counter tests which check for an always increasing (or decreasing) counter value| boolean
| tweakLen | The domain of values allowed for ACVP-AES-FF1's tweak value. Allowed range is 0-128 bits mod 8. See <<property_grid_misc>> | domain
| capabilities | An array of objects that describes an IUT's capabilities as they pertain to ACVP-AES-FF1 and ACVP-AES-FF3-1. See <<property_grid_misc>> and <<property_grid_ff_capabilities>> | Array of Objects
| dataUnitLen | The length(s) of the ACVP-AES-XTS data unit supported by the IUT. It is assumed that all lengths listed by the dataUnitLen property are also valid payload lengths. As such, the values for the payloadLen property *MUST* include all dataUnitLen values. If the value of the dataUnitLenMatchesPayload property is false, the dataUnitLen property SHALL be present; if the value of the dataUnitLenMatchesPayload property is true, the dataUnitLen parameter SHALL not be present. | domain
| dataUnitLenMatchesPayload | Whether or not the length of the data unit always matches the length of the payload in ACVP-AES-XTS | boolean
|===

NOTE: The 'conformances' property is only valid for algorithms listed in <<conformances>>. The valid values in the array are also listed in that section. The array is always optional.

NOTE: Some optional values are required depending on the algorithm. For example, AES-GCM requires ivLen, ivGen, ivGenMode, aadLen and tagLen. Failure to provide these values will result in the ACVP server returning an error to the ACVP client during registration.

NOTE: The 'performCounterTests' option is provided for counter implementations such as linear-feedback shift registers which may not present an always increasing or decreasing counter while still ensuring the IV is unique. This value defaults to true if not present. If it is set to false, the 'overflowCounter' and 'incrementalCounter' values will not be used.

The following grid outlines which properties are *REQUIRED*, as well as all the possible values a server *MAY* support for each standard block cipher algorithm:

NOTE: The ivGenMode property is used for AES-GCM/AES-XPN algorithms to document which IV construction method the implementation conforms to: the deterministic construction defined in SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 or the RBG-based construction defined in SP 800-38D section 8.2.2.

NOTE: For AES-CCM-ECMA, the IV/NONCE is used to create a pre-formatted "B_0 block" containing 16-bytes as defined by Fig 113 in ECMA-368 Sec 18.5.

NOTE: The ivLen for AES-CCM-ECMA *SHALL* be 104-bits.

The following grid outlines which properties are *REQUIRED*, as well as the possible values a server *MAY* support for the XTS block cipher algorithm:

[[property_grid_xts]]
.XTS Block Cipher Algorithm Capabilities Applicability Grid

|===

NOTE: The difference in testing between ACVP-AES-XTS / "1.0" and ACVP-AES-XTS / "2.0" is the inclusion of the data unit in the "2.0" revision. The <<AES-XTS>> standard provides the concept of a data unit as a means of logically breaking apart a data stream provided to the encryption algorithm. A data unit may be larger, smaller or equal to the payload being processed. In the case of the "1.0" revision, the data unit length always matches the payload length. Thus, the equivalent of the "1.0" revision can be accessed via the "2.0" revision by setting the 'dataUnitLenMatchesPayload' field to true. Within the prompt, in "1.0", the test group contains the payload length for the entire group. In "2.0" this is moved to the test case level and handled on a per case basis along with the data unit length. Both values may be provided in the test case JSON even when 'dataUnitLenMatchesPayload' is true.
