== Test Vector Responses

After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it *SHALL* send the response vectors back to the ACVP server within the alloted timeframe. The following table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set response.

.Vector Set Response JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type

| acvVersion| Protocol version identifier| string
| vsId| Unique numeric identifier for the vector set| integer
| testGroups| Array of JSON objects that represent each test vector group. See <<vr_group_table>>| array of testGroup objects
|===

The testGroup Response section is used to organize the ACVP client response in a similar manner to how it receives vectors. Several algorithms *SHALL* require the client to send back group level properties in its response. This structure helps accommodate that.

.Vector Set Group Response JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type

| tgId| The test group identifier| integer
| tests| The tests associated to the group specified in tgId| array of testCase objects
|===

Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single test object to be processed by the ACVP client. The following table describes the JSON elements for each test case object.

[cols="<,<,<"]
[[vs_tr_table]]
.Test Case Results JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type

| tcId| Numeric identifier for the test case, unique across the entire vector set.| integer
| pt| The IUT's pt response to a decrypt test| string (hex)
| ct| The IUT's ct response to an encrypt test| string (hex)
| testPassed| Some test cases included with decrypt operations in AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-XPN, AES-KW, AES-KWP, and TDES-KW will have expected failures. | boolean
| resultsArray| Array of JSON objects that represent each iteration of a Monte Carlo Test. Each iteration will contain the key(s), pt, ct and iv| array of objects containing pt, ct and iv (except for ECB mode)
|===

NOTE: The tcId *MUST* be included in every test case object sent between the client and the server.
