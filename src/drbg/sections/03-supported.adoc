== Supported DRBGs

The following deterministic random bit generator algorithms *MAY* be advertised by the ACVP compliant cryptographic module:

* hashDRBG
* hmacDRBG
* ctrDRBG

=== Counter DRBG Triple-DES

The "ctrDRBG-TDES" mode shall only be used with the three-key option of the Triple-DES algorithm.

NOTE: TDES is no longer supported and is end-of-life as of 1/1/2024; please refer to https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf for more information.
