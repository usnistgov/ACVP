    <abstract>
      <t>The ACV Protocol provides a method for communication between a cryptographic module 
        that is embedded inside of a device or otherwise running on a platform accessible via computer network, and an
        external testing system, using standard network communication interfaces and protocols. This communication
        protocol can also be used to validate the correctness of the algorithm implementations in the cryptographic
        module with a validation authority.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The ACV Protocol(ACVP) introduces a method to perform cryptographic 
         assessment and validations at a rate which meets typical industry development cycles.
         This provides the ability to deploy validated crypto with CVE fixes much faster
         than previous methods. This document describes how it is structured with respect
         to the client-server model, the messaging protocol, optional features and flows.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="caps_reg" title="Overview">
      <t>ACVP has the following goals:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t> To work in situations where the testing system is remote from the cryptographic
            module, e.g. running as a process on a separate device.</t>
          <t> To enable automated testing that can take place with a minimum of human
            interaction.</t>
          <t> To enable the testing system to discover the capabilities of the module being tested;
            that is, the particular algorithms and parameters that the module supports.</t>
          <t> To provide extensibility that can be used to introduce tests for new algorithms, and
            new tests for existing algorithms.</t>
          <t> To be compatible with emerging automated validation systems wherever possible,
            especially the FIPS-140 Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program.</t>
          <t> To provide a standard communication method so that vendors can utilize the same
            testing service for FIPS-140, 3rd party crypto verification and product FCS readiness
            testing.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>ACVP defines how to communicate a request (to execute a cryptographic operation) to a
        cryptographic module, and how to communicate the corresponding response (containing the
        output of that operation) back to a testing system. It defines a transport (based on HTTP or
        HTTPS  <xref target="RFC7230"></xref>), an JSON message structure(which is negotiated), and a set of message
        exchanges. Each vector test set corresponds to a single message exchange driven from the
        client associated with the module under test. ACVP does not define the cryptographic
        algorithms, nor does it detail the precise conditions for a response to be acceptable.
        Instead, it references existing specifications for those algorithms, and defines a mapping
        between the data on the wire and the algorithm testing specification. ACVP does not define
        detailed conformance criteria, such as those in FIPS-140. Instead, it aims to be independent
        of particular conformance criteria, so that it can be used in multiple domains with
        different (even potentially conflicting) conformance criteria. ACVP does not define an
        interface that can be used to manage or control a cryptographic module.</t>
      <section title="Audience">
        <t>This document is written to address multiple audiences:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> Crypto module developers who require validation testing</t>
            <t> Crypto module developers who require runtime crypto assessment testing</t>
            <t> Crypto validation organizations who will perform validation testing</t>
            <t> Crypto module customers that desire validation testing results or verifiable artifacts of testing</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Goals">
        <t>The goals for this document are to provide a messaging protocol that can be used with
          existing authentication and communication protocols to provide a way to test crypto
          modules. The following functions are outside the scope of this document:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> The API to the cryptographic module</t>
            <t> How the tests are generated</t>
            <t> How the results/artifacts are stored or managed</t>
            <t> Authentication used</t>
            <t> Scalability</t>
            <t> Management interface</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>With that in mind there are several expectations when building a server used as a
          validation authority. A validation authority SHALL use a combination of HTTPS
          <xref target="RFC7230"></xref>, TLS 1.2
          <xref target="RFC5246"></xref>
          or greater and mutual authentication. Therefore a client that expects to be used with a validation
          authority SHALL have the same requirements. A server, proxy or client developed for the
          purposes of internal organizational testing only MAY choose not to include some of those features.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Architecture">
        <t>A server/client/proxy model is used where the roles are defined as:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> ACV Client - Communicates with the ACV server using Java Script Object Notation (JSON <xref
              target="RFC7159"></xref>) and collects the test vectors and returns the test results using product
              specific methods.</t>
            <t> ACV Server - Sends JSON formatted messaging and test data to the ACV client and
              processes test responses.</t>
            <t> ACV Proxy - Resides between the ACV server and ACV client to proxy the connection
              for the client. This is particularly useful when the client does not support TLS, key
              management or have signature capabilities and they are required by the server. An
              example architecture is provided in Figure 3.</t>
            <t> Device Under Test - Contains the crypto module under test which
              can include various algorithms and functions that encrypt/decrypt, generate keys,
              signatures, perform verifications and DRBG functions. May also contain the ACVP
              client.</t>
            <t> Cryptographic Module API - This is the interface, manual or otherwise,
              to the crypto module. This interface is environment specific and will 
              vary depending on
              the crypto module and may not be limited to real-time operation. </t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The following terms are consistently used throughout this document and SHOULD be used throughout its
          extensions:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Test Session - The largest structure of an instance of ACVP. Often generated from a 
            single registration, it will contain many Test Vector Sets for the algorithms defined 
            in the registration.</t>
            <t>Test Vector Set - The set of tests and data corresponding to an individual algorithm
            from within a registration. Uniquely identified throughout an instance of ACVP by the 
            vsId. Contains many Test Groups.</t>
            <t>Test Group - The set of tests that share common properties within a Test Vector Set. 
            Uniquely identified within the Test Vector Set by the tgId. Contains many Test Cases.</t>
            <t>Test Case - The smallest unit of the tests that represents an individual testable
            operation as defined by the parent Test Group. Uniquely identified throughout the 
            Test Vector Set by the tcId.</t>
            <t>Registration - The JSON from the client to the server that describes the algorithms 
            and capabilities for which the client is seeking test cases and a validation. A 
            Registration can submit capabilities for multiple algorithms. Each algorithm will be
            broken into individual Test Vector Sets.</t>
            <t>Request - The JSON sent from the server to the client defining a single Test 
            Vector Set to use as inputs for testing. Exactly one request will exist for each 
            Test Vector Set.</t>
            <t>Response - The JSON from the client providing the desired cryptographic output
            for each of the Test Cases defined in the corresponding Request file. These are linked
            via the Test Vector Set vsId. As exactly one request exists for each vsId, one response
            will exist for each request.</t>
            <t>Disposition - The JSON from the server after the Response is submitted by the client
            detailing the correctness of the Test Cases. A "passed" disposition indicates that the
            particular algorithm in the Test Vector Set is ready for validation.</t>
            <t>OE - Operational Environment - The specific hardware and/or software the client's
            cryptographic implementation uses to run.</t>
            <t>Realtime - For the purposes of this document realtime is defined as the client
            receiving a vector set and immediately performing the tests and returning the results
            to the server. In general, this is a case where the ACVP client and crypto module
            reside in the same box and directly communicate with each other. Non-realtime would
            refer to the case where the client may gather vector sets from the server and through
            some means introduce them to the crypto module gather the results and send them back
            to the server.  In general, this is a case where the device hosting the crypto module
            cannot communicate directly with the ACVP client.</t>

        <t> The resource path is appended to the path prefix to form the URI used with an HTTP
          Method to perform the desired ACVP operation. For example to create a new test session
          using the "/testSessions" resource is "/acvp/v1/testSessions" (assuming an empty context).
          To create a new Test Session, the ACVP client would use the following HTTP request-line: </t>
        <t>POST /acvp/v1/testSessions HTTP/1.1</t>

        <t>Likewise, to request a specific vector set from the server the ACVP client would use the
          following request-line:</t>

        <t>GET /acvp/v1/testSessions/1/vectorSets/1 HTTP/1.1</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that HTTPS and TLS 1.2 or greater be used in order to enforce a secure
        communication method. Not all environments will have TLS so HTTP with some level of
        authentication may be the only option.</t>

    <section title="Authentication">
      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that an authentication scheme be used. Typically, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is created by the
        server upon successful client authentication and returned to the client to use as an authorization mechanism for
        accessing the server resources - see <xref target="jwtToken"/> below for more information.  Depending on the
        target environment and usage objectives, the authentication can be as weak as basic HTTP authentication or as
        strong as TLS mutual certificate authentication. Definition of an authentication scheme will not be discussed
        here, but should be agreed upon between the client and server owning entities including the servers owned by the
        validation authorities. The <xref target="login">login</xref> endpoint will be discussed for the purposes of
        establishing a test session but how a client is authenticated to the server is not prescribed.
      </t>
    </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Encoding">
      <t>The encoding used for the request/response messaging will be JSON (<xref
      target="RFC7159"></xref>). The data will be
        identified by: Content-type: application/json In order to allow environment specific
        extensions to a particular version of the ACV protocol, a top-level JSON keyword, extensions
        will be used to extend the OE description and/or the capabilities. Extensions MAY be ignored
        by the ACV server. Vector and vector response data will be JSON encoded.</t>
    </section>
   
    <section title="Submission Size Considerations">
    	<t>Some server implementations MAY require alternative handling for submission sizes that exceed
    	  resource limitations of the normal workflow for a <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> response. Server
    	  implementations MUST indicate whether the server requires large submission handling and what the maxmimum value
    	  for non-large submissions is within the <xref target="login">/login</xref> response.

    <section anchor="login" title="Login">

        A login endpoint is mentioned throughout the document and although how to authenticate is left up to the server
        the following description is an example of the login endpoint to establish a session and obtain a

        additions and enhancements that do not disrupt compatibility will be indicated with a minor
        version change. A server MAY accept a down-level version from the client if it can process
        at a lower level. If not, it will reject the session. All subsequent messages will carry the
        negotiated version value.</t>

      <section title="Product Registration/Capabilities Exchange">
        <t>The product registration will utilize the URI resources  <xref target="uriResources"/> to register and
          provide cryptographic capabilities.  This exchange will consist of several message exchanges and will provide
          a detailed list of cryptographic algorithms and their options to be tested during the testSession, see
          <xref target="xml_msgFlows"/>, retrieval of test vectors, submission of test responses, determining test
          result, and a certification step to associate the product and tested environment information with the
          completed test. A set URI resources are also available to retrieve and manage the available metadata such as
          companay name, primary contact, product descriptions, and operational environment descriptions.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Test Exchange">
        <t>The test exchange consists of the ACV client requesting a particular vectorSet
          associated with the testSession. The server responds with the vectorSet. The client MAY retreive and process
          the vectorSets in order and MAY retreive a vectorSet and immediately return results or request all of the
          vectorSets and return results at a later time.
          The client repeats this process until all of the vectorSets in the testSession
          list have been processed. Once a vectorSet result has been POSTed to the server
          the client may request success/failure results from the server at any time,
          however if vectorSets have not been completed the overall status will be incomplete.

      <t>
        <cref>Vector Sets or Test Sessions? It would be far simpler if it was Test Session based
          rather than Vector Set based.</cref> Vector sets can expire. For example, in terms of a
        validation authority use, the vector sets are one-time use only. Old vector sets can never
        be reused to obtain a new validation certificate for an algorithm implementation or to
        update an existing certificate. Expiration is a server specific definition which depends on
        database costs, need for artifacts, etc. If the vector set has expired, the server will
        reply with an expired response when the client attempts to download the vector set:

      <t>The ACVP protocol requires server implementations to generate test values and retain the
        data while the ACVP client processes and returns the results. Some crypto modules
        implementing the client-side ACVP protocol may not return results immediately. The ACVP
        protocol design implies the server must retain the test values to verify the client test
        responses at some time in the future. However, some test vector sets are fairly large, which
        could place significant storage requirements on ACVP server implementations. To alleviate
        long term storage requirements, ACVP allows for an expiration timestamp to be set when a
        test vector set is generated by the server.</t>
      <t>The vector set expiration timestamp must be included by the server in the vector set when
        the client downloads the vector set. The server may change the expiration timestamp of a
        previously issued vector set to extend its lifetime subject to server policy. The expiration
        timestamp must be in the 'expiry' JSON value, which is included in the JSON encoded vector
        set. The expiry JSON value will be a string value of the UTC timestamp using form
        "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". The following figure shows a partial JSON encoded vector set that
        contains the expiry value.</t>

    <section title="Algorithm Test Extensions">
      <t>ACVP is intended to be an extensible protocol that supports testing of a large number of cryptographic 
        algorithms from several different classes defined by the community.
        All algorithm identifiers intended for public use SHALL be documented by IANA in the ACVP IANA Registry <xref target="acvp-iana"/>.</t>

        <t>To add testing for a new algorithm first try to find an algorithm of the same type that is already supported by the protocol.</t> 
        <t>If it belongs to an already-supported type, check the test specification for the similar algorithm. Typically, similar algorithms share similar testing methodology. </t> 

        <t>For example, the testing of symmetric block ciphers is comprised of two test types: Algorithm Functional Tests and Monte Carlo Tests - 
        see <xref target="sub-symmetric"/>. </t>

        <t>Assuming that the existing test types provide sufficient test coverage for the new algorithm, one needs to add the 
        new block cipher algorithm to the symmertic block cipher specification <xref target="sub-symmetric"/>, 
        including the JSON schema for the corresponding test data exchanges between the validation server and the client. 
        See in particular Section "Adding new algorithms" in the corresponding algorithm specification.</t>

	<t>Next, one needs to update the IANA registry with the new algorithm by adding it to the corresponding namespace and subject to the policies stated in <xref target="acvp-iana"/>.</t>
        <t>Once this is completed and the corresponding server test generation and validation for that algorithm are implemented, 
        testing can commence. Clients implementing that algorithm may register it for testing as described in Section "Capabilities Registration" in 
        <xref target="sub-symmetric"/>, process the test vectors generated by the validation server and return the results for validation. 
        </t>
        <t>If the available test types for an algorithm, existing or new, in a given class do not provide good test coverage of the algorithm, 
        one could develop a new test type and incorporate it into the corresponding test specification for the that algorithm. See for example Section "Adding new algorithms" in 
        <xref target="sub-symmetric"/> for how to add a new test type. Note that this action would require modifications of the corresponding algorithm test specification and would result in a new version of that test specification to be reflected in the IANA registry  <xref target="acvp-iana"/>.</t>

      <t>All JSON keywords SHALL use lower camelCase format with no underscores or hyphens and use
        the following characters only a-z, A-Z, 0-9. Keywords SHALL abbreviate common words and
        phrases wherever possible for brevity.</t>

      <t>For example: password length - pwLen plain text length - ptLen </t>

      <t>Keywords SHOULD be chosen such that they are informative and brief, for example: </t>

      <t> [ { "acvVersion": acvp-version }, { "results" : { "disposition" : "incomplete" } } ] </t>
      <t>Metadata assigned to the keyword may use any format which best reflects the information
        being represented including hyphens, underscores alternating case, numbers, etc. However,
        brevity should be a major consideration, for example:</t>
      <t> "algorithms" : [ { "algorithm" : "ACVP-AES-GCM", "mode" : "modes", "ivGen" : "internal",
        "ivGenMode" : "8.2.1" } All metadata representing strings or big numbers SHALL use double
        quotes at both ends. Big numbers require conversion from strings to whatever format is used
        by the DUT. Numerical values of integer size or with decimal points may use quotations if
        those values are generally used as a string, for example the acvVersion would generally be
        used in displaying information not in any mathematical operations. Something like keyLen or
        ptLen values would be better used without quotes to avoid having to convert the string to an
        integer for use in the code. </t>

                     figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                     Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                     added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                     images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the 
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.  -->
