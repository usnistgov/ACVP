		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism to automatically
				verify the cryptographic implementation of a software or hardware crypto module. The
				ACVP specification defines how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server,
				including crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
				vector processing and more. The ACVP specification does not define algorithm
				specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto validation. A series of ACVP
				sub-specifications define the constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.
				Each sub-specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms. This
				sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing KAS FFC algorithms using
				ACVP.</t>

				<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
					"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
					interpreted in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>. </t>

		<section anchor="test_types" title="Test Types and Test Coverage">
			<t>The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the KAS protocol in order to assess the
				correctness and robustness of the implementation. A typical ACVP validation session
				would require multiple tests to be performed for every supported permutation of KAS
				capabilities. This section describes the design of the tests used to validate
				implementations of KAS algorithms. There are two test types for KAS testing: <list
					style="testtype">
					<t>"AFT" - Algorithm Function Test. In the AFT test mode, the IUT MUST
						act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server. The server SHALL 
						generate and provide all necessary information for the IUT to perform a
						successful key agreement; both the server and IUT MAY act as party U/V, as
						well as recipient/provider to key confirmation.</t>
					<t>"VAL" - Validation test. In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server generates a
						complete (from both party U and party V's perspectives) key agreement, and
						REQUIRES the IUT to determine if that agreement is valid. Various
						types of errors SHALL be introduced in varying portions of the key agreement
						process (changed DKM, changed key, changed hash, etc), that the IUT MUST be able
						to detect and report on.</t>
				</list>

			<section anchor="test_coverage" title="Test Coverage">
                <t>The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring an
                    implementation is conformant to <xref target="SP800-56a"/>. </t>

                            <t>SP 800-56a - 4.1 Key Establishment Preparations. The ACVP server is
                                responsible for generating domain parameters as per the IUT's
                                capability registration.</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 4.2 Key-Agreement Process. Both the ACVP server and IUT
                                participate in the Key Agreement process. The server and IUT can
                                both take the roles of party U/V, and as such the "performer" of
                                steps depicted in "Figure 2: Key Agreement process" can vary.</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions. All modes of
                                performing KAS SHALL make use of a hash function. The hash function MAY
                                be used for confirmation of a successfully generated shared secret Z
                                (noKdfNoKc), or as a primitive within the KDF being tested (kdfNoKc
                                and kdfKc).</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.2 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithm. A MAC
                                is utilized for confirmation of success for kdfNoKc and kdfKc modes
                                of KAS. Note - a MAC prerequisite is REQUIRED only for kdfKc, though
                                is utilized for both kdfNoKc and kdfKc.</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.4 Nonce. Nonces are made use of in various KAS schemes
                                - both the ACVP server and IUT SHALL be expected to generate
                                nonces.</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.6 Domain Parameters. Domain Parameter Generation SHALL be 
                                performed solely from the ACVP server, with constraints from the
                                IUTs capabilities registration. The same set of domain parameters SHALL
                                generate all keypairs (party U/V, static/ephemeral) for a single test case.</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation. While Key-Pairs are used in
                                each KAS scheme, the generation of said key-pairs is out of scope
                                for KAS testing. Random tests from the VAL groups, MAY inject bad
                                keypairs that the IUT MUST be able detect. These random tests are
                                only present in groups given appropriate assurance functions see:

                                Primitives. Depending on the scheme used, either Diffie Hellman or
                                MQV SHALL be used to negotiate a shared secret of z. Testing and
                                validation of such key exchanges is covered under their respective
                                schemes.</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.8 Key-Derivation Methods for Key-Agreement Schemes.
                                All schemes/modes save noKdfNoKc (component) MUST make use of a KDF. KDF
                                construction SHALL utilize <xref target="oiPatternConstruction"/> for its

                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.9 Key Confirmation. Most KAS schemes allow for a Key
                                Confirmation process, the ACVP server and IUT MAY be Providers or
                                Recipients of said confirmation. Additionally, key confirmation MAY
                                be performed on one or both parties (depending on scheme).</t>
                            <t>SP 800-56a - 6 Key Agreement Schemes. All schemes specified in
                                referenced document are supported for validation with the ACVP

                            <t>SP 800-56a - 5.4 Nonce. Nonce generation is utilized for several

                                section 5.5 MUST be used, however their generation SHALL NOT

				describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with KAS FFC algorithms.</t>
			<t>The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that contains meta data
