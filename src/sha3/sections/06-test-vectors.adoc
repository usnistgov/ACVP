=== Test Groups

Test vector sets *MUST* contain one or many test groups, each sharing similar properties. For instance, all test vectors that use the same key size would be grouped together. The testGroups element at the top level of the test vector JSON object SHALL be the array of test groups. The Test Group JSON object *MUST* contain meta-data that applies to all test cases within the group. The following table describes the JSON elements that *MUST* appear from the server in the Test Group JSON object:

.Test Group JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type

| tgId| Numeric identifier for the test group, unique across the entire vector set.| integer
| testType| Test category type. AFT, MCT or VOT as defined in <<testtypes>>| value
| mctVersion | When testType is MCT, the type of MCT being run, i.e., "standard" or "alternate" | string
| maxOutLen | When testType is MCT and the algorithm is SHAKE, the largest supported output length as provided via the outputLen property in the registration.  | integer
| minOutLen | When testType is MCT and the algorithm is SHAKE, the smallest supported output length as provided via the outputLen property in the registration.  | integer
| tests| Array of individual test case JSON objects, which are defined in	<<tcjs>>| array of testCase objects

=== Test Case JSON Schema

Each test group *SHALL* contain an array of one or more test cases.  Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single case to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON elements for each test case.

.Test Case JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value| Description| JSON type

| tcId| Numeric identifier for the test case, unique across the entire vector set.| integer
| len| Length of the message or seed. Applicable to AFT, VOT, and MCT test types. | integer
| outLen| Length of the digest. Only applicable when the algorithm is SHAKE-128 or SHAKE-256 and the test type is AFT or VOT. | integer
| msg| Value of the message or seed.  Messages are represented as little-endian hex for all SHA3 variations. Applicable to AFT, VOT, and MCT test types. | string (hex)
| largeMsg | Object describing the message for an LDT group | large data object, see <<LD_test>> for more information
|===

NOTE: The maximum value for SHAKE-128 for 'len' is 65,904 bits when the inBit parameter is set to true in the capabilities registration and 66,240 bits when it is set to false. The maximum value for SHAKE-256 for 'len' is 66,428 bits when the inBit parameter is set to true in the capabilities registration and 65,752 bits when it is set to false.

The following are example JSON objects for secure hash test vectors sent from the ACVP server to the crypto module. Notice that the single bit message is represented as "01". This complies with the little-endian nature of SHA3. All hex displayed is little-endian bit order when associated with SHA3 or any of its variations.
