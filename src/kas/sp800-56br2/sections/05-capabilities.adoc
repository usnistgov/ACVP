=== Prerequisite Algorithms for KAS IFC Validations

Some algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic primitives. For example, IKEv2 uses an underlying SHA algorithm. Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the same submission. ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

[[onestepnocounterkdf]]
====== One Step No Counter KDF Capabilities

The one step no counter KDF is a special implementation of the one step KDF.  This implementation of the KDF does not utilize a 32 bit counter as a part of the concatenation that gets fed into function `H`.  As such, there is no loop within the KDF due to there being no information changing between iterations of the potential concatenation, and the KDF output length is capped at the output length of the chosen aux function (or 2048 in the case of KMAC).

IUTs *MUST* be capable of specifying how the FixedInfo is constructed for the KAS/KTS negotiation. Note that for the purposes of testing against the ACVP system, both uPartyInfo and vPartyInfo are *REQUIRED* to be registered within the fixed info pattern.

Pattern candidates:

* literal[0123456789ABCDEF]

** uses the specified hex within "[]". literal[0123456789ABCDEF]
substitutes "0123456789ABCDEF" in place of the field

* uPartyInfo
  ** uPartyId { || ephemeralKey } { || ephemeralNonce } { || dkmNonce }
    *** "optional" items such as ephemeralKey *MUST* be included when available for ACVP testing.
    *** For the purposes of the testing defined in this specification, the uPartyInfo value
    used to create the fixedInfo that is input to the key derivation function *SHALL* take the form of "uPartyId { || ephemeralKey } 
    { || ephemeralNonce } { || dkmNonce }".
    *** Whether or not an "optional" item, e.g., ephemeralKey, will be included as part of the uPartyInfo
    for a given test case is dependant on the scheme and party being tested. Please consult <<scheme_generation_requirements>> for more information.

* vPartyInfo
  ** vPartyId { || ephemeralKey } { || ephemeralNonce } { || dkmNonce }
    *** "optional" items such as ephemeralKey *MUST* be included when available for ACVP testing.

    used to create the fixedInfo that is input to the key derivation function *SHALL* take the form of "vPartyId { || ephemeralKey } 
    { || ephemeralNonce } { || dkmNonce }".
    *** Whether or not an "optional" item, e.g., ephemeralKey, will be included as part of the vPartyInfo
    for a given test case is dependant on the scheme and party being tested. Please consult <<scheme_generation_requirements>> for more information.
    
* context
  ** Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the context.

* algorithmId
  ** Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the
algorithmId.

* label
  ** Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the label.

* l
  ** The length of the derived keying material in bits, *MUST* be represented in 32 bits for ACVP testing.

Example (Note that party U is the server in this case "434156536964", party V is the IUT "a1b2c3d4e5"):
