1.  Abstract

   The ACV Protocol provides a method for communication between a
   cryptographic module that is embedded inside of a device or otherwise
   running on a platform accessible via computer network, and an
   external testing system, using standard network communication
   interfaces and protocols.  This communication protocol can also be
   used to validate the correctness of the algorithm implementations in
   the cryptographic module with a validation authority.

2.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  It introduces a method to
   perform cryptographic assessment and validations at a rate which
   meets typical industry development cycles; providing the ability to
   deploy validated crypto with CVE fixes much faster than previous
   methods.

   The ACVP specification describes how the protocol is structured with
   respect to the client-server model, messaging, optional features, and
   flows.  It defines how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP

   server; including crypto capabilities negotiation, session
   management, authentication, vector processing and more.  The ACVP
   specification does not define algorithm specific JSON constructs for
   performing the crypto validation.  A series of ACVP sub-
   specifications define the constructs for testing individual crypto
   algorithms.

4.  Overview

   ACVP has the following goals:

   *  To work in situations where the testing system is remote from the
      cryptographic module, e.g. running as a process on a separate
      device.

   *  To enable automated testing that can take place with a minimum of
      human interaction.

   *  To enable the testing system to discover the capabilities of the
      module being tested; that is, the particular algorithms and
      parameters that the module supports.

   *  To provide extensibility that can be used to introduce tests for
      new algorithms, and new tests for existing algorithms.

   *  To be compatible with emerging automated validation systems
      wherever possible, especially the FIPS-140 Cryptographic Algorithm
      Validation Program.

   *  To provide a standard communication method so that vendors can
      utilize the same testing service for FIPS-140, 3rd party crypto
      verification and product FCS readiness testing.

   ACVP defines how to communicate a request (to execute a cryptographic
   operation) to a cryptographic module, and how to communicate the
   corresponding response (containing the output of that operation) back
   to a testing system.  It defines a transport (based on HTTP or HTTPS
   [RFC7230]), an JSON message structure(which is negotiated), and a set
   of message exchanges.  Each vector test set corresponds to a single
   message exchange driven from the client associated with the module
   under test.  ACVP does not define the cryptographic algorithms, nor
   does it detail the precise conditions for a response to be
   acceptable.  Instead, it references existing specifications for those
   algorithms, and defines a mapping between the data on the wire and
   the algorithm testing specification.  ACVP does not define detailed
   conformance criteria, such as those in FIPS-140.  Instead, it aims to
   be independent of particular conformance criteria, so that it can be
   used in multiple domains with different (even potentially
   conflicting) conformance criteria.  ACVP does not define an interface
   that can be used to manage or control a cryptographic module.

4.1.  Audience

   This document is written to address multiple audiences:

   *  Crypto module developers who require validation testing

   *  Crypto module developers who require runtime crypto assessment
      testing

   *  Crypto validation organizations who will perform validation
      testing

   *  Crypto module customers that desire validation testing results or
      verifiable artifacts of testing

4.2.  Goals

   The goals for this document are to provide a messaging protocol that
   can be used with existing authentication and communication protocols
   to provide a way to test crypto modules.  The following functions are
   outside the scope of this document:

   *  The API to the cryptographic module

   *  How the tests are generated

   *  How the results/artifacts are stored or managed

   *  Authentication used

   *  Scalability

   *  Management interface

   With that in mind there are several expectations when building a
   server used as a validation authority.  A validation authority SHALL
   use a combination of HTTPS [RFC7230], TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] or greater
   and mutual authentication.  Therefore a client that expects to be
   used with a validation authority SHALL have the same requirements.  A
   server, proxy or client developed for the purposes of internal
   organizational testing only MAY choose not to include some of those
   features.

5.  Architecture

   A server/client/proxy model is used where the roles are defined as:

   *  ACV Client - Communicates with the ACV server using Java Script
      Object Notation (JSON [RFC7159]) and collects the test vectors and
      returns the test results using product specific methods.

   *  ACV Server - Sends JSON formatted messaging and test data to the
      ACV client and processes test responses.

   *  ACV Proxy - Resides between the ACV server and ACV client to proxy
      the connection for the client.  This is particularly useful when
      the client does not support TLS, key management or have signature
      capabilities and they are required by the server.  An example
      architecture is provided in Figure 3.

   *  Device Under Test - Contains the crypto module under test which
      can include various algorithms and functions that encrypt/decrypt,
      generate keys, signatures, perform verifications and DRBG
      functions.  May also contain the ACVP client.

   *  Cryptographic Module API - This is the interface, manual or
      otherwise, to the crypto module.  This interface is environment
      specific and will vary depending on the crypto module and may not
      be limited to real-time operation.

5.4.  Terminology

   The following terms are consistently used throughout this document
   and SHOULD be used throughout its extensions:

   *  Test Session - The largest structure of an instance of ACVP.
      Often generated from a single registration, it will contain many
      Test Vector Sets for the algorithms defined in the registration.

   *  Test Vector Set - The set of tests and data corresponding to an
      individual algorithm from within a registration.  Uniquely
      identified throughout an instance of ACVP by the vsId.  Contains
      many Test Groups.

Internet-Draft                ACVP Protocol                 October 2025


   *  Test Group - The set of tests that share common properties within
      a Test Vector Set. Uniquely identified within the Test Vector Set
      by the tgId.  Contains many Test Cases.

   *  Test Case - The smallest unit of the tests that represents an
      individual testable operation as defined by the parent Test Group.
      Uniquely identified throughout the Test Vector Set by the tcId.

   *  Registration - The JSON from the client to the server that
      describes the algorithms and capabilities for which the client is
      seeking test cases and a validation.  A Registration can submit
      capabilities for multiple algorithms.  Each algorithm will be
      broken into individual Test Vector Sets.

   *  Request - The JSON sent from the server to the client defining a
      single Test Vector Set to use as inputs for testing.  Exactly one
      request will exist for each Test Vector Set.

   *  Response - The JSON from the client providing the desired
      cryptographic output for each of the Test Cases defined in the
      corresponding Request file.  These are linked via the Test Vector
      Set vsId.  As exactly one request exists for each vsId, one
      response will exist for each request.

   *  Disposition - The JSON from the server after the Response is
      submitted by the client detailing the correctness of the Test
      Cases.  A "passed" disposition indicates that the particular
      algorithm in the Test Vector Set is ready for validation.

   *  OE - Operational Environment - The specific hardware and/or
      software the client's cryptographic implementation uses to run.

   *  Realtime - For the purposes of this document realtime is defined
      as the client receiving a vector set and immediately performing
      the tests and returning the results to the server.  In general,
      this is a case where the ACVP client and crypto module reside in
      the same box and directly communicate with each other.  Non-
      realtime would refer to the case where the client may gather
      vector sets from the server and through some means introduce them
      to the crypto module gather the results and send them back to the
      server.  In general, this is a case where the device hosting the
      crypto module cannot communicate directly with the ACVP client.

6.  ACV Protocol

   The ACV protocol will utilize existing mechanisms for transport
   coordinated with JSON formatted messaging.

   Note that deployments utilizing ACV Proxy server MAY use a different
   protocol, e.g., HTTP, custom server, context and port number to
   interact with the DUT.

6.2.  HTTP URI Resources

   In the table below, any parts of a resource path enclosed in curly
   braces, { or }, are replaced by an instance of what is described in
   the braces.  For example {testSessionId} could be replaced with 1.

   An empty cell for a resource and HTTP Method combination denotes that
   the server returns an HTTP Status 405 code _Method not allowed
   (405)_.

             Table 1: Resources and their Available Operations

   The resource path is appended to the path prefix to form the URI used
   with an HTTP Method to perform the desired ACVP operation.  For
   example to create a new test session using the "/testSessions"
   resource is "/acvp/v1/testSessions" (assuming an empty context).  To
   create a new Test Session, the ACVP client would use the following
   HTTP request-line:

   POST /acvp/v1/testSessions HTTP/1.1

   Likewise, to request a specific vector set from the server the ACVP
   client would use the following request-line:

   GET /acvp/v1/testSessions/1/vectorSets/1 HTTP/1.1

7.  Security Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that HTTPS and TLS 1.2 or greater be used in order
   to enforce a secure communication method.  Not all environments will
   have TLS so HTTP with some level of authentication may be the only
   option.

Internet-Draft                ACVP Protocol                 October 2025


7.1.  Authentication

   It is RECOMMENDED that an authentication scheme be used.  Typically,
   a JSON Web Token (JWT) is created by the server upon successful
   client authentication and returned to the client to use as an
   authorization mechanism for accessing the server resources - see
   Section 12.3 below for more information.  Depending on the target
   environment and usage objectives, the authentication can be as weak
   as basic HTTP authentication or as strong as TLS mutual certificate
   authentication.  Definition of an authentication scheme will not be
   discussed here, but should be agreed upon between the client and
   server owning entities including the servers owned by the validation
   authorities.  The Section 10 endpoint will be discussed for the
   purposes of establishing a test session but how a client is
   authenticated to the server is not prescribed.

8.  Encoding

   The encoding used for the request/response messaging will be JSON
   ([RFC7159]).  The data will be identified by: Content-type:
   application/json In order to allow environment specific extensions to
   a particular version of the ACV protocol, a top-level JSON keyword,
   extensions will be used to extend the OE description and/or the
   capabilities.  Extensions MAY be ignored by the ACV server.  Vector
   and vector response data will be JSON encoded.

9.  Submission Size Considerations

   Some server implementations MAY require alternative handling for
   submission sizes that exceed resource limitations of the normal
   workflow for a POST response.  Server implementations MUST indicate
   whether the server requires large submission handling and what the
   maxmimum value for non-large submissions is within the Section 10
   response.

10.  Login

   A login endpoint is mentioned throughout the document and although
   how to authenticate is left up to the server the following
   description is an example of the login endpoint to establish a
   session and obtain a Section 12.3.1.  See Section 13 for more
   information on how to handle data which exceeds the sizeConstraint in
   the event the value of largeEndpointRequired is true.

   *  *password* - string, a property for providing a password value

   *  *accessToken* - string, a JWT associated with the current user for
      which renewal of the expiration is desired

Internet-Draft                ACVP Protocol                 October 2025


   *  *largeEndpointRequired* - boolean, true if the server requires the
      large endpoint for submissions with a size that exceeds the value
      found in *sizeConstraint*.

   *  *sizeConstraint* - number, provides the maximum value, in bytes,
      of a submission not required to use the Section 13 or -1 if
      largeEndpointRequired is false.

10.1.  Request

   There are two forms of a login request.  There is the initial form
   which just provides the authentication information without any JWT,
   and there is a renewal login that allows a user to obtain a new JWT
   containing the claims from an expired JWT in order to access a
   resource protected with those claims.

   *POST /login* (Initial)

   [
     {"acvVersion": "{acvp-version}"},
     {
       "password": "{password}"
     }
   ]

   *POST /login* (Renewal)

   [
     {"acvVersion": "{acvp-version}"},
     {
       "password": "{password}",
       "accessToken": "{jwt value}"
     }
   ]

10.2.  Response

   [
     {"acvVersion": "{acvp-version}"},
     {
       "accessToken": "{jwt value}",
       "largeEndpointRequired": false,
       "sizeConstraint": -1
     }
   ]

10.3.  Multi Refresh JWT

   This endpoint can be utilized for refreshing multiple JWTs with a
   single POST.  Because a JWT with claims is issued for each test
   session created and clients have the option of performing more than
   one test session at a time, a mechanism for refreshing multiple JWTs
   across multiple test sessions simultaneously MAY be made available.

10.3.1.  Request

   *POST /login/refresh*

   [
     {"acvVersion": "{acvp-version}"},
     {
       "password": "{password}",
       "accessToken": [
         "{jwt1}",
         "{jwt2}",
         "..."
       ]
     }
   ]

10.3.2.  Response

   [
     {"acvVersion": "{acvp-version}"},
     {
       "accessToken": [
         "{newJwt1}",
         "{newJwt2}",
         "..."
       ],
       "largeEndpointRequired": false,
       "sizeConstraint": -1
     }
   ]

   Note the order of JWTs between the request and response is preserved.

11.  Versioning

   The version of the ACVP protocol will be carried with each message
   and will contain a simple major.minor format.  Major version changes
   will not be backward compatible, however additions and enhancements
   that do not disrupt compatibility will be indicated with a minor
   version change.  A server MAY accept a down-level version from the
   client if it can process at a lower level.  If not, it will reject
   the session.  All subsequent messages will carry the negotiated
   version value.

12.  Messaging and Workflow

12.1.  Product Registration/Capabilities Exchange

   The product registration will utilize the URI resources Section 6.2
   to register and provide cryptographic capabilities.  This exchange
   will consist of several message exchanges and will provide a detailed
   list of cryptographic algorithms and their options to be tested
   during the testSession, see Section 12.4, Paragraph 2, retrieval of
   test vectors, submission of test responses, determining test result,
   and a certification step to associate the product and tested
   environment information with the completed test.  A set URI resources
   are also available to retrieve and manage the available metadata such
   as companay name, primary contact, product descriptions, and
   operational environment descriptions.

12.2.  Test Exchange

   The test exchange consists of the ACV client requesting a particular
   vectorSet associated with the testSession.  The server responds with
   the vectorSet.  The client MAY retreive and process the vectorSets in
   order and MAY retreive a vectorSet and immediately return results or
   request all of the vectorSets and return results at a later time.
   The client repeats this process until all of the vectorSets in the
   testSession list have been processed.  Once a vectorSet result has
   been POSTed to the server the client may request success/failure
   results from the server at any time, however if vectorSets have not
   been completed the overall status will be incomplete.  A minimal
   message flow is described below Section 12.4, Paragraph 2.

12.3.  JSON Web Token (JWT)

   JSON Web Token is described in [RFC7519] and is used as an
   authorization mechanism for gaining access to different resources.

   {
       "alg" : "none"
   }
   {
       "iss" : "nist.gov",
       "nbf": 1598293915,
       "exp": 1598295715,
       "iat": 1598293915,
       "pkey" : "cc74f56acdba635079383a03941d68db55c7b3c2f (truncated)"
   }
   {

   }

   The JWT can be secured if desired using the header encryption "alg"
   value defined to HS256(HMAC-SHA256) or one of the other secure
   values.  Key agreement would follow RFC7518.

   {
     "alg": "HS256",
     "typ": "JWT"
   }
   {
     "iss" : "nist.gov",
     "nbf": 1598293915,
     "exp": 1598295715,
     "iat": 1598293915,
     "pkey" : "cc74f56acdba635079383a03941d68db55c7b3c2f (truncated)"
   }
   {
       "{signature}"
   }

   where "{signature}" is made up of:

   HMACSHA256(
     base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
     base64UrlEncode(payload),
     secret)

                                  Figure 6

   and where "HMACSHA256" is the algorithm specified in the JWT header.

   The first four claims are required, however "pkey" is an optional
   private claim used to pass the key used for encrypting the database
   at the server.  Enabling this option is discussed further in
   Section 12.16.2

12.3.1.  Authorization flows with JWT

   JSON Web Token is described in [RFC7519] and is used as an
   authorization mechanism for gaining access to different resources.

   In order to access any resource which requires authorization a client
   must supply the JWT as an Authorization header value as a Bearer
   token.  An example header value is:

       Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5c (truncated)"

12.3.2.  JWT Expiration/Renewal

   The JWT access tokens received from either the /login server endpoint
   SHALL be set to expire after a pre-defined period.  The specific
   length of the expiration period is out of scope for this
   specification.  However, the expiration period length impacts both
   the security and protocol overhead.  Longer expiration periods reduce
   the overhead but increase the window for attacks.  Attempting to
   access a service with an expired JWT SHALL result in a "401
   Unauthorized" HTTP status code.

   A client may renew an expired JWT access token using the mechanism
   shown in Section 12.3.2, Paragraph 3below.

12.5.  Paging

   Some resource operations require paging in order to avoid returning
   large amounts of data.  Each operation that uses paging will indicate
   that uses paging and what the value for each element will be within
   the section describing that operation.  All paged responses MUST
   follow the format described in Section 12.5.2.  Conversely, clients
   may navigate pages using the paging parameters described in
   Section 12.5.1.  Server implementations SHOULD impose limitations on
   the page size limit based on resource constraints.

12.5.1.  Parameters

   A Server MUST accept requests without paging parameters.  If not all
   results are returned, the response MUST indicate that not all of the
   results were provided using the incomplete property of a paged
   response described in Section 12.5.2.  The query parameters clients
   MUST use to specify paging are described below:

   *  *limit* - number, the maximum number of entries to return.  Server
      implementations MUST allow requests without a provided value, but
      the default value is a choice for server implementations.

   *  *offset* - number, the offset into the list of entries, MUST
      default to 0 if not provided.

   GET /acvp/v1/vendors?offset=20&limit=20 HTTP/1.1

Internet-Draft                ACVP Protocol                 October 2025


12.5.2.  Response

   A paged response has the following properties:

   *  *totalCount* - number, the total number of resources available to
      return

   *  *incomplete* - boolean, true if more resources are avaiable than
      what is returned in the response

   *  *links* - object, links to use when navigating the pages

      -  *first* - string, a link to the first page in the result set

      -  *next* - string, a link to the next page in the result set,
         null if no next page is available

      -  *prev* - string, a link to the previous page in the result set,
         null if no previous page is available

      -  *last* - string, a link to the last page in the result set

   *  *data* - array, contains an array of data appropriate to the
      resource requested

     [
         {"acvVersion": <acvp-version>},
         {
             "totalCount" : 22007,
             "incomplete" : true,
             "links" : {
                 "first" : "/acvp/v1/<resource>?offset=0&limit=20",
                 "next" : "/acvp/v1/<resource>?offset=20&limit=20",
                 "prev" : null,
                 "last" : "/acvp/v1/<resource>?offset=22000&limit=20"
             },
             "data" : [ <resource response> ]
         }

12.6.  Query Parameters

   Some of the resource listing operations allow for query parameters to
   be provided to filter out the returned values.  Each resource will
   list what properties and operations are available but the general
   format of the query parameter string is consistent across all
   resources.  The format allows for the specification of complex
   filters with the concept of groups, where all elements in the same
   group MUST be AND'ed together and different groups are OR'ed
   together.  The URL including the parameter values MUST conform to
   [RFC3986] and MUST use UTF-8 character encoding.

   General format of a query parameter element.

   <property>[<index>]=<operation>:<value>

                                 Figure 14

   *  *property* - is the property to be specified

   *  *index* - is an arbitrary group index, elements with same group
      index are AND'ed together and elements with different indices are
      OR'ed togther. index MUST be between 0 and 99 inclusive.

   *  *operation* - is an operation on a property and a value.  Not all
      operations require a value, and not all properties will permit
      every operation.  Available operations are:

      -  *eq* - filter based on property equal to the value

      -  *ne* - filter based on the property not equal to the value

      -  *gt* - filter based on the property greater than the value

      -  *ge* - filter based on the property greater than or equal to
         the value

      -  *lt* - filter based on the property less than the value

      -  *le* - filter based on the property less than or equal to the
         value

      -  *contains* - filter based on the property containing the value

      -  *start* - filter based on the property starting with the value

      -  *end* - filter based on the property ending with the value

Internet-Draft                ACVP Protocol                 October 2025


   *  *value* - the value to filter on, it MAY be constrained based on
      the property

   Example 1

   /resource?property1[0]=eq:foo&property2[0]=eq:foo
   &property1[1]=eq:test&property2[1]=ne:bar

                                 Figure 15

   For the example above the results returned would include resources
   that have: property1 equal to foo and property2 equal to foo or
   resources that have property1 equal to test and property2 not equal
   to bar.

   Example 2 based on Section 12.8.1.

   /vendors?name[0]=contains:acme&name[1]=contains:test

                                 Figure 16

   For the example above the vendor results returned would include
   resources that have a name property value that contains either acme
   or test.

12.7.  Requests

   Some resource operations make a request to modify or create data.  To
   facilitate an out-of-band approval step, where data can be inspected
   to insure it meets the business requirements of the validation
   authority which operates the server, the operations will return a
   request url that can be used to obtain information about the status
   and disposition of the requested modification.  Whether or how an
   authority implements an approval step is outside the scope of this
   specification.

   A request resource is not externally updateable, but SHOULD update
   based on server processing.  The properties for a request response:

   *  *url* - string, identifier for this resource

   *  *status* - string, one of:

      -  *initial* - initial state of the request, created

      -  *processing* - server is processing the request

      -  *approved* - the requested operation was successfully processed

      -  *rejected* - the requested operation was rejected and no change
         was made

   *  *message* - string, a placeholder for any message describing a
      rejection

   *  *approvedUrl* - string, a link to the resource which was created
      or modified as a result of the requested operation

12.7.1.  Request Listing

12.17.6.  Update Results Submission

   *PUT /testSessions/{testSessionId}/vectorSets/{vectorSetId}/results*

   Update Vector Set Test Results Submission.

   When one or more test cases fails, the client will need to correct
   the issue in the crypto module and send the responses again.  The
   resending of responses for failed test cases will occur for an entire
   vector set.  Therefore, even if only a single test case in the vector
   set failed, the client will need to download, process, and upload
   responses to the server for the entire vector set (presumably after
   the problem has been corrected in the implementation).  The resending
   of vector set responses MUST occur prior to expiry.

13.  Large Submission

   When clients have a response which exceeds the sizeConstraint in

   POST to the /large endpoint in order to obtain the URI to use.

   The available properties for large submissions:

   *  *submissionSize* - number, the maximum size in bytes of the
      desired submission.

   *  *vectorSetUrl* - string, an identifier of the vector set that will
      be uploaded as a large submission.

   *  *url* - string, a one-time use url value to use for a large
      submission.

   *  *accessToken* - string, an optional JWT, that if provided, clients
      MUST use when accessing the url.  If not provided, clients MUST
      use their current accessToken when accessing the url.

14.  Vector Set Expiration

   Vector sets can expire.  For example, in terms of a validation
   authority use, the vector sets are one-time use only.  Old vector
   sets can never be reused to obtain a new validation certificate for
   an algorithm implementation or to update an existing certificate.
   Expiration is a server specific definition which depends on database
   costs, need for artifacts, etc.  If the vector set has expired, the
   server will reply with an expired response when the client attempts
   to download the vector set:

   [
       {"acvVersion": "{acvp-version}"},
       {
           "vsId": 42,
           "status": "expired"
       }
   ]

   The ACVP protocol requires server implementations to generate test
   values and retain the data while the ACVP client processes and
   returns the results.  Some crypto modules implementing the client-
   side ACVP protocol may not return results immediately.  The ACVP
   protocol design implies the server must retain the test values to
   verify the client test responses at some time in the future.
   However, some test vector sets are fairly large, which could place
   significant storage requirements on ACVP server implementations.  To
   alleviate long term storage requirements, ACVP allows for an
   expiration timestamp to be set when a test vector set is generated by
   the server.

   The vector set expiration timestamp must be included by the server in
   the vector set when the client downloads the vector set.  The server
   may change the expiration timestamp of a previously issued vector set
   to extend its lifetime subject to server policy.  The expiration
   timestamp must be in the 'expiry' JSON value, which is included in
   the JSON encoded vector set.  The expiry JSON value will be a string
   value of the UTC timestamp using form "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".  The
   following figure shows a partial JSON encoded vector set that
   contains the expiry value.

15.  Error Codes

   Errors will follow HTTP[S] numbering scheme.  In addition errors as
   well as 200 messages may carry JSON encoded information that
   describes in detail the error and any associated troubleshooting
   information.  Examples of client and server error messages are in
   Appendix B.

16.  Algorithm Test Extensions

   ACVP is intended to be an extensible protocol that supports testing
   of a large number of cryptographic algorithms from several different
   classes defined by the community.  All algorithm identifiers intended
   for public use SHALL be documented by IANA in the ACVP IANA Registry
   [acvp-iana].

   To add testing for a new algorithm first try to find an algorithm of
   the same type that is already supported by the protocol.

   If it belongs to an already-supported type, check the test
   specification for the similar algorithm.  Typically, similar
   algorithms share similar testing methodology.

   For example, the testing of symmetric block ciphers is comprised of
   two test types: Algorithm Functional Tests and Monte Carlo Tests -
   see [sub-symmetric].

   Assuming that the existing test types provide sufficient test
   coverage for the new algorithm, one needs to add the new block cipher
   algorithm to the symmertic block cipher specification
   [sub-symmetric], including the JSON schema for the corresponding test
   data exchanges between the validation server and the client.  See in
   particular Section "Adding new algorithms" in the corresponding
   algorithm specification.

   Next, one needs to update the IANA registry with the new algorithm by
   adding it to the corresponding namespace and subject to the policies
   stated in [acvp-iana].

   Once this is completed and the corresponding server test generation
   and validation for that algorithm are implemented, testing can
   commence.  Clients implementing that algorithm may register it for
   testing as described in Section "Capabilities Registration" in
   [sub-symmetric], process the test vectors generated by the validation
   server and return the results for validation.

Internet-Draft                ACVP Protocol                 October 2025


   If the available test types for an algorithm, existing or new, in a
   given class do not provide good test coverage of the algorithm, one
   could develop a new test type and incorporate it into the
   corresponding test specification for the that algorithm.  See for
   example Section "Adding new algorithms" in [sub-symmetric] for how to
   add a new test type.  Note that this action would require
   modifications of the corresponding algorithm test specification and
   would result in a new version of that test specification to be
   reflected in the IANA registry [acvp-iana].

17.  Custom Specification Objects

17.1.  Date

   A date type is a time string formatted according to the rules of
   [RFC3339]; all date/times must use UTC time denoted by 'Z' suffix
   with no local timezone adjustment.  Example is 2018-06-01T20:10:33Z

17.2.  BitString

   Bitstrings are used to communicate a string of bits between the ACVP
   server and IUT.

17.2.1.  Endianness

   BitStrings SHALL be considered in big endian order, unless otherwise
   specified by the algorithm.

   The hex string "FA" (assuming all bits are considered) SHALL
   represent the bits 11111010 (in MSb) or the value 250.

17.2.2.  Hex to Bitstring Parsing

   "valueLen" will be used as the example, but it can apply to any bit
   length registration/vector set/etc parameters.

   When a "value" is provided along with a "valueLen", the "valueLen"
   MUST be considered when parsing the hex string represented in
   "value", *EXCEPT* in empty bitstring cases, which MUST be represented
   as an empty string "".  Parsing Hex strings into Bit strings is
   especially important for algorithms such as the SHA variations that
   may only include a portion of bits from the provided hex string.
   When only a portion of bits from a Hex string are considered, bits
   for use in the bitstring SHALL be taken from the most significant
   bits, meaning the lesser significant bits are the bits that are
   dropped.

17.2.2.1.  Hex string parsing examples

   *  valueLen: 8, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 11111010, or
      the value 250.

   *  valueLen: 7, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 1111101, or
      the value 125.

   *  valueLen: 5, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 11111, or
      the value 31.

   *  valueLen: 3, value: "FA", SHALL be parsed as the bits 111, or the
      value 7.

   *  valueLen: 0, value: "", SHALL be interpreted as an empty bit
      string.

17.3.  Range

   The Range object can be used to convey a range of values.  It
   contains its own set of properties made up of "min", "max", and
   "increment". "inc" may be used as a shorthand for "increment."  If
   the "increment" property is omitted, a default value of 1 SHALL be
   used.

17.3.1.  Range JSON examples

   A range object specifying a minimum of 1, a maximum of 8, with an
   increment of 1.  This range object includes the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
   6, 7, and 8.

   {"myRange": {
       "min": 1,
       "max": 8,
       "increment": 1
   }}

   A range object specifying a minimum of 0, a maximum of 8, with an
   increment of 2.  This range object includes the values 0, 2, 4, 6,
   and 8.

   {"myRange": {
       "min": 0,
       "max": 8,
       "increment": 2
   }}

Internet-Draft                ACVP Protocol                 October 2025


17.4.  Domain

   The Domain object can be used to specify a set of values similar to
   Range, albeit with more control.  A domain can be made up of an array
   of objects, where those objects can be literal values, and/or Range
   objects.

17.4.1.  Domain JSON examples

   Several sample domain objects that state 0, 8, 16, 32, 96, 128, 192,
   and 256 are valid values.

   {"myDomain": [
       {
           "min": 0,
           "max": 16,
           "increment": 8
       },
       32,
       96,
       {
           "min": 128,
           "max": 256,
           "increment": 64
       }
   ]}

   {"myDomain": [ 0, 8, 16, 32, 96, 128, 192, 256 ]}

17.4.2.  Additional Domain Information

   Because the Domain is an array of objects consisting of (potentially)
   both literals and ranges, algorithms that use an array of integers
   can be used interchangably with the Domain object.

18.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action by IANA.

19.  Other Considerations

   When an ACVP client is attached to a cryptographic module that is in
   use, access to ACVP MUST be controlled so that only an administrator
   or other authorized user can send and receive ACVP messages.  This is
   because an attacker that has access to ACVP can potentially use it to
   probe for weaknesses in the cryptographic module.

   underscores or hyphens and use the following characters only a-z,
   A-Z, 0-9.  Keywords SHALL abbreviate common words and phrases
   wherever possible for brevity.

   For example: password length - pwLen plain text length - ptLen

   Keywords SHOULD be chosen such that they are informative and brief,
   for example:

   [
       { "acvVersion": "{acvp-version}" },
       { "results" : { "disposition" : "incomplete" } }
   ]

   Metadata assigned to the keyword may use any format which best
   reflects the information being represented including hyphens,
   underscores alternating case, numbers, etc.  However, brevity should
   be a major consideration, for example:

   {
       "algorithms" : [
           { "algorithm" : "ACVP-AES-GCM", "mode" : "modes", "ivGen" : "internal", "ivGenMode" : "8.2.1" }
       ]
   }

   All metadata representing strings or big numbers SHALL use double
   quotes at both ends.  Big numbers require conversion from strings to
   whatever format is used by the DUT.  Numerical values of integer size
   or with decimal points may use quotations if those values are
   generally used as a string, for example the acvVersion would
   generally be used in displaying information not in any mathematical
   operations.  Something like keyLen or ptLen values would be better
   used without quotes to avoid having to convert the string to an
   integer for use in the code.

22.  Error Messages

   General or registration errors detected by the server SHALL result in
   an HTML error and description of the problem, for example:

            HTTP response: 400
            "error" : "Incorrectly formatted JSON (51:18):
                       expected field name was not provided: inBit"

                                 Figure 17

   Errors detected by the client SHOULD trigger an indication of the
   operation that failed and a detailed error description.  This
   information can be sent to the clients local logging facility to
   provide traceability of communication issues, for example:

                       ACV Operation: SHA-512
                       Error: Unsupported hash algorithm
