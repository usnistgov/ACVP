2.  Abstract

   This document defines the JSON schema for testing RSA implementations
   with the ACVP specification.

3.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing RSA
   implementations using ACVP.

   This document is a work-product of the NIST (https://www.nist.gov/)
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
   (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-
   program) (CAVP).  Please communicate questions and feedback
   concerning this document to the CAVP by opening an issue on the
   usnistgov/ACVP GitHub repository at

6.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   This section describes the design of the tests used to validate RSA
   implementations.

6.1.  Test Types

   There are multiple test types depending on the algorithm and mode.
   Each has a specific value to be used in the testType field.  The
   testType field definitions are:

   "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test.  These tests can be processed by
   the client using a normal 'generate_key', 'sign', 'verify' or
   'decrypt' operation depending on the mode.  AFTs cause the
   implementation under test to exercise normal operations.  In all
   cases, random data is used.  The functional tests are designed to
   verify that the logical components of the process are operating
   correctly.

   "GDT" - Generated Data Test.  These tests require the client to
   generate all inputs and outputs in order to demonstrate their full
   capabilities in cases where input from the server might not be
   applicable.

   "KAT" - Known Answer Test.  These tests are staticly defined and are
   included in every vector set that matches their capabilities.

6.2.  Test Types Per Mode

   As each mode requires different tests, how each test type is
   processed may change depending on the mode.

   ACVP servers that support RSA keyGen MAY support AFTs, GDTs, and
   KATs.  The AFTs and GDTs *REQUIRE* the client to generate RSA key
   pairs based on the test group properties provided.  The KATs
   *REQUIRE* the client to attempt to generate a key with specific
   starting 'p' and 'q' values via the Random Probable Prime method
   defined in [FIPS186-4] and [FIPS186-5].

   ACVP servers that support RSA sigGen MAY support GDTs.  The GDTs
   *REQUIRE* the client to generate a key pair and sign a message
   provided by the server based on the test group properties provided.
   The client provides the signature and public key to the server for
   verification.

Internet-Draft                  ACVP RSA                   December 2025


   ACVP servers that support RSA sigVer MAY support GDTs.  The GDTs
   *REQUIRE* the client to verify provided signatures given a message
   and public key.  The client provides the verification result back to
   the server.

   ACVP servers that support RSA LegacysigVer MAY support GDTs.  The
   GDTs *REQUIRE* the client to verify provided signatures given a
   message and public key.  The client provides the verification result
   back to the server.

   ACVP servers that support RSA SignaturePrimitive MAY support AFTs.
   The AFTs *REQUIRE* the client to determine whether or not the
   provided message can be signed with the provided public key.  If so,
   also provide the signature for verification.

   ACVP servers that support RSA DecryptionPrimitive MAY support AFTs.
   The AFTs *REQUIRE* the client to determine whether or not the
   provided ciphertext can be decrypted with the provided public key.
   If so, also provide the plaintext for verification.

6.3.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document are intended to ensure an
   implementation conformant with the requirements listed below.  For
   clarity, related requirements not covered are also provided.

6.3.1.  Requirements Covered

   *  FIPS 186-4 Section 3 General Discussion.  Key generation,
      signature generation, and signature validation are all within
      scope of ACVP server testing.

   *  FIPS 186-4 Section 5 The RSA Digital Signature Algorithm.  The
      ACVP server provides a means of testing the generation of RSA
      keys.  The ACVP server SHALL support a variety of RSA capabilities
      functionS for the creation and delivery of tests to/from the IUT.
      Key pair generation testing SHALL be provided by the ACVP server.
      Both Signature Generation and Validation testing mechanisms SHALL
      be provided by the ACVP server.

   *  FIPS 186-2.  The ACVP server MAY provide a means of testing legacy
      RSA functions such as RSA sigVer.  This testing is provided to
      ensure an IUT is capable of verifying a signature that is no
      longer approved for generation, given the same capabilities.

Internet-Draft                  ACVP RSA                   December 2025


   *  SP800-106 Section 3 Randomized Hashing and Section 4 Digital
      Signatures Using Randomized Hashing.  The IUT SHALL be provided or
      provide a random value that should be used to "randomize" a
      message prior to signing and/or verifying an original message.

6.3.2.  Requirements Not Covered

   *  FIPS 186-4 Section 3 General Discussion.  Assurances of private
      key secrecy and ownership SHALL NOT be within scope of ACVP
      testing.

   *  FIPS 186-4 Section 5 The RSA Digital Signature Algorithm.  Though
      the ACVP server SHALL support a variety of parameter sizes hash
      functions, the IUT's selection of these is out of scope of
      testing.  Key pair management SHALL NOT be within scope of ACVP
      testing.

   *  SP800-106 Section 3.3 The Random Value.  DSA, ECDSA, and RSA have
      random values generated as per their signing process, this random
      value can be used as the input to the message randomization
      function, doing so however is out of scope of this testing.

7.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of RSA algorithms to the ACVP
   server.

   The algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within
   the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification [ACVP] for more
   details on the registration message.

7.1.  Prerequisites

   Each algorithm implementation MAY rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, RSA Signature algorithms depend on an
   underlying hash function.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

Internet-Draft                  ACVP RSA                   December 2025


   Prerequisites, if applicable, MUST be submitted in the registration
   as the prereqVals JSON property array inside each element of the
   algorithms array.  Each element in the prereqVals array MUST contain
   the following properties

        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | JSON Property | Description                 | JSON Type |
        +===============+=============================+===========+
        | algorithm     | a prerequisite algorithm    | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+
        | valValue      | algorithm validation number | string    |
        +---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+

                      Table 2: Prerequisite Properties

   A "valValue" of "same" SHALL be used to indicate that the
   prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability
   exchange in the same registration.

   An example description of prerequisites within a single algorithm
   capability exchange looks like this

   "prereqVals":
   [
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg1",
       "valValue": "Val-1234"
     },
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg2",
       "valValue": "same"
     }
   ]

7.2.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for RSA Validations

   Each RSA implementation relies on other cryptographic primitives.
   For example, RSA keyGen often uses an underlying SHA algorithm.  Each
   of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated, either
   separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

7.8.  RSA SignaturePrimitive Mode Capabilities

   The RSA signaturePrimitive mode capabilities (otherwise known as
   RSASP1 in [RFC3447]) are advertised as JSON objects within the array
   of 'capabilities' as part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the
   ACVP JSON registration message.  See the ACVP specification for
   details on the registration message.  In this mode, the only tested
   capability is the correct exponentiation of 's = msg^d mod n', where
   'msg' is a message between '0' and 'n - 1', 'd' is the private
   exponent and 'n' is the modulus, all supplied by the testing ACVP
   server.  In the event that 'keyFormat' is defined as 'crt', then 'd'
   is replaced with 'dmp1', 'dmq1', and 'iqmp'.  For RSA /
   SignaturePrimitive / 1.0, only 2048-bit RSA keys are allowed for this
   capability.  For RSA / SignaturePrimitive / 2.0, 2048-bit, 3072-bit,
   and 4096-bit modulus sizes are supported.  See Section 8.7 for
   additional details on constraints for 'msg' and 'n'.  See the ACVP
   specification for details on the registration message.

   The following RSA / SignaturePrimitive / 1.0 capabilities MAY be

           4096
       ]
   }

7.9.  RSA DecryptionPrimitive v1.0 Mode Capabilities

   Note: RSA DecryptionPrimitive v1.0 should be used for PIV card
   testing, and RSA DecryptionPrimitive Sp800-56Br2 for comforming to
   Sp800-56Br2 requirements.

   The RSA decryptionPrimitive mode capabilities are advertised as JSON
   objects within the array of 'capabilities' as part of the
   'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON registration message.
   A single property is allowed in the registration, 'modulo' with the
   only approved value of 2048.  In this mode, the only tested
   capability is the correct exponentiation 's = cipherText\^d mod n',
   where 'cipherText' is a cipherText to be decrypted, 'd' is the
   private exponent and 'n' is the modulus.  See [SP800-56B],
   Section 7.1.2 for details.

   In testing, only 'cipherText' is supplied by the ACVP server.  The
   client is responsible for generating RSA key pairs of modulus 'n',
   private key 'd', and calculates 's'.  If a client does not support
   decryption with a standard RSA private exponent 'd', the equivalent
   Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) private key values are allowed to be
   used.  Only 2048-bit RSA keys are allowed for this capability.

   See Section 8.11 for additional details on constraints for
   'cipherText' and 'n'.  The client provides the public exponent 'e',
   modulus 'n' and the computed result 's' in its response to the ACVP -
   see Section 9.5.  The client must first check if '0 < cipherText <
   n-1' and return an error if this is not the case.  The client returns
   a value 's' only when 'cipherText' is in the proper range for the
   size of the selected modulus 'n'.  See the ACVP specification for
   details on the registration message.

   An example registration is the following

   {
       "algorithm": "RSA",
       "mode": "decryptionPrimitive",
       "revision": "1.0",
       "prereqVals":
       [
           {"algorithm": "DRBG", "valValue": "123456"},
           {"algorithm": "DRBG", "valValue": "654321"},
           {"algorithm": "SHA", "valValue": "7890"}
       ]
   }

7.10.  RSA DecryptionPrimitive SP800-56Br2 Mode Capabilities

   The RSA decryptionPrimitive mode capabilities are advertised as JSON
   objects within the array of 'capabilities' as part of the
   'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON registration message.
   Two properties are supported in the registration.  A 'modulo' array
   supports three modulus values of 2048, 3072, and 4096.  For private
   'keyFormat', the "standard" and "crt" (Chinese Remainder Theorem)
   private key formats are supported. "standard" equates to the prime-
   factor private key format described in [SP800-56Br2].  See the
   descriptions of basic, CRT, and prime-factor private key formats in
   Section 3.2 of [SP800-56Br2].

   When testing the "standard"/prime-factor private key format, a
   ciphertext (ct), along with private key p, q and d component values
   are provided, see [SP800-56Br2], Section 7.1.2.2 for details.  If an
   IUT supports the basic private key format, the p and q values
   provided by the "standard"/prime-factor testing can be multiplied to
   produce the needed n value.  When testing for the Chinese Remainder
   Theorem private key format, a ciphertext (ct), the p, q, n, dmp1
   (dP), dmq1 (dQ), and iqmp (qInv) values are provided, see
   [SP800-56Br2], Section 7.1.2.3 for details.  See the ACVP
   specification for details on the registration message.

   Support was added for fixed public exponents, this is done through
   two settings, 'pubExpMode' and fixedPubExp'.  When 'pubExpMode' is
   set to 'fixed', a 'fixedPubExp' is required.  An omitted pubExpMode
   will default to random.

8.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual crypto algorithm, such as RSA /
   sigGen / FIPS186-4, RSA / keyVer / FIPS186-5, etc.  This section
   describes the JSON schema for a test vector set used with RSA crypto
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

               Table 16: RSA keyGen Test Group JSON Object

   The 'tgId', 'testType' and 'tests' objects MUST appear in every test
   group element communicated from the server to the client as a part of
   a prompt.  Other properties are dependent on which 'testType' (see
   Section 6) the group is addressing.

   The impact of the 'infoGeneratedByServer' property depends on the
   other properties identified in the keyGen registration.  For
   'randPQs' of B.3.2, B.3.4, B.3.5, and B.3.6 (or the corresponding
   FIPS186-5 values), 'infoGeneratedByServer' set to true will provide
   the client with ALL the inputs and expect them to arrive at the same
   output the server has already arrived at.

Internet-Draft                  ACVP RSA                   December 2025


   In the case of 'infoGeneratedByServer' being set to false during the
   registration, the client will be provided with SOME of the inputs,
   like an already agreed upon fixed public exponent.  However, in
   general the server will send mostly empty test cases.  It is the
   responsibility of the client to generate both the input properties
   and output properties comprising the test cases and communicate ALL
   of those back to the server.  The server will try to reach the same
   output key.

   For B.3.3 (or the corresponding FIPS186-5 value of probable),
   'infoGeneratedByServer' set to true enables the KAT test groups if
   the client supports a random public exponent.  The GDT are always
   enabled as a bare minimum test for B.3.3 (or probable), independent
   of the 'infoGeneratedByServer' setting.

8.2.  RSA keyGen Test Case JSON Schema

   Each test group contains an array of one or more test cases.  Each
   test case is a JSON object that represents a single test vector to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each RSA / keyGen / * test vector.

   The difference between revision "FIPS186-4" and "FIPS186-5" within
   the prompts lies in the strings used by the server to refer to the
   various "randPQ", and "primeTest" modes.  Revision "FIPS186-4"
   utilizes the section number from [FIPS186-4] to refer to the
   algorithm used while revision "FIPS186-5" utilizes a description of
   the algorithm.

   Here is an abbreviated yet fully constructed example of the prompt
   for RSA / sigGen / FIPS186-4.  The only difference in the structure
   between RSA / sigGen / FIPS186-4 and RSA / sigGen / FIPS186-5 is the
   inclusion of the 'maskFunction' property in the 'testGroup' for RSA /
   sigGen / FIPS186-5.

8.5.  RSA sigVer Test Groups JSON Schema

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the RSA / sigVer / * JSON elements of the
   Test Group JSON object

9.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it must
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

     +===============+===================================+===========+
     | JSON Property | Description                       | JSON Type |
     +===============+===================================+===========+
     | acvVersion    | The version of the protocol       | string    |
     +---------------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
     | vsId          | The vector set identifier         | integer   |
     +---------------+-----------------------------------+-----------+
     | testGroups    | The test group data, see Table 31 | array     |
     +---------------+-----------------------------------+-----------+

                       Table 30: Response JSON Object

   An example of this is the following

   {
           "acvVersion": "version",
           "vsId": 1,
           "testGroups": [ ... ]
   }

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.  The following is a
   skeleton for the test group structure.  Additional properties may be
   included at this level depending on the algorithm, mode and revision.

   +==========+=============================================+=========+
   | JSON     | Description                                 | JSON    |
   | Property |                                             | Type    |
   +==========+=============================================+=========+
   | tgId     | The test group identifier                   | integer |
   +----------+---------------------------------------------+---------+
   | tests    | The test case data, depending on the        | array   |
   |          | algorithm see Table 32, Table 34, Table 36, |         |
   |          | Table 37, Table 38, Table 39 or Table 40    |         |
   +----------+---------------------------------------------+---------+

                Table 31: Response Test Group JSON Objects

   An example of this is the following

   }

9.1.  RSA keyGen Test Group Responses

   Each test group contains an array of one or more test cases.  Each
   test case is a JSON object that represents a single test vector to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each RSA / keyGen / * test vector.

   The following table describes the JSON elements for the response to a
   RSA / keyGen / * test vector.

   Use the following applicability grid to determine which properties

   generation methods.  The RSA / keyGen / FIPS186-5 names will be
   listed in the grid.  This grid only applies to 'AFT' test types.

        Table 33: RSA Test Case Applicability Grid For AFT Responses

      |  NOTE: If the 'crt' key format is used for the group, substitute
      |  'd' with the appropriate values from Table 32.

   The following is an example of an RSA / keyGen / * response.  Test
   group 1 uses the provable prime (B.3.2) generation method.  Test
   group 2 uses the provable prime with conditions (B.3.4) generation
   method.  Test group 3 uses the provable prime with probable
   conditions (B.3.5) generation method.  Test group 4 uses the probable
   prime with conditions (B.3.6) generation method.  Test group 5 is for
   the 'KAT' test type for probable prime (B.3.3) generation method.
   Test group 6 uses the probable prime (B.3.3) generation method.  In
   this example, 'infoGeneratedByServer' is set to true.
