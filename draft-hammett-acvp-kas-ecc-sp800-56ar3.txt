2.  Abstract

   This document defines the JSON schema for testing SP800-56Ar3 KAS ECC
   implementations with the ACVP specification.

3.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing SP800-56Ar3
   KAS ECC implementations using ACVP.

   This document is a work-product of the NIST (https://www.nist.gov/)
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
   (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-
   program) (CAVP).  Please communicate questions and feedback
   concerning this document to the CAVP by opening an issue on the
   usnistgov/ACVP GitHub repository at

6.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the KAS protocol in order
   to assess the correctness and robustness of the implementation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session SHALL require multiple tests to be
   performed for every supported permutation of KAS capabilities.  This
   section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of KAS algorithms.

6.1.  Test Types

   There are two test types for KAS testing:

   *  "AFT" - Algorithm Function Test.  In the AFT test mode, the IUT
      SHALL act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server.
      The server SHALL generate and provide all necessary information
      for the IUT to perform a successful key agreement; both the server
      and IUT MAY act as party U/V, as well as recipient/provider to key
      confirmation.

   *  "VAL" - Validation Test.  In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server
      MUST generate a complete (from both party U and party V's
      perspectives) key agreement, and expects the IUT to be able to
      determine if that agreement is valid.  Various types of errors
      MUST be introduced in varying portions of the key agreement
      process (changed DKM, changed key, changed hash digest, etc), that
      the IUT MUST be able to detect and report on.

6.2.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [SP800-56Ar3].

6.2.1.  KAS-ECC Requirements Covered

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions.  SHA1, SHA2, and
      SHA3 hash functions SHALL be available for the various pieces of
      KAS requiring use of a hash function; such as approved MACs and
      OneStep KDF.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.2 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithms.
      AES-CMAC, HMAC, and KMAC algorithms SHALL be available for testing
      under KDFs and KC as the specification states.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.3 Random Number Generation.  Though random values
      are used, the testing of the construction of those random values
      SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.4 Nonces.  Though nonces are used, the testing of
      the construction of those nonces SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP
      testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.5 Domain Parameters.  Domain Parameters SHALL be
      used in the testing of KAS as per the specification, though the
      generation of those parameters is outside the scope of testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation.  Each KAS scheme from one
      or both parties utilizes a key pair for arriving at a shared
      secret, and deriving a key.  Though a key pair(s) are utilized in
      ACVP testing, the testing of the generation of said key pairs is
      outside the scope of this testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.7 DLC Primitives.  Diffie Hellman and MQV SHALL
      be tested under their respective KAS schemes.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.8 Key-Derivation Methods for Key-Establishment
      Schemes.  The ACVP server SHALL make various KDFs available for
      testing.  The KDFs covered under ACVP server testing SHALL include
      the KDFs specified in SP800-56B, SP800-56C, SP800-108, and
      SP800-135 (where applicable).

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.9 KeyConfirmation.  The ACVP server SHALL support
      key confirmation for applicable KAS and KTS schemes.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 6 Key Agreement Schemes.  The ACVP server SHALL
      support testing for all KAS schemes specified in the SP800-56Ar3
      document.

   *  SP 800-56Cr1 - 4 One-Step Key Derivation.  One-Step Key Derivation
      testing SHALL be supported by the ACVP server.  FixedInfo
      construction is covered within the ACVP specification, and can be
      tailored to the IUTs needs.  ASN.1 format of fixedInfo
      construction (currently) is NOT supported.

   *  SP 800-56Cr1 - 5 Two-Step Key Derivation.  Two-Step Key Derivation
      testing SHALL be supported by the ACVP server.  FixedInfo
      construction is covered within the ACVP specification, and can be
      tailored to the IUTs needs.  ASN.1 format of fixedInfo
      construction (currently) is NOT supported.

   *  SP 800-108 - 4 Pseudorandom Function (PRF).  All iterations of the
      KDF described in SP800-108 use a separate PRF.  All
      implementations of the PRF SHALL be available for testing through
      the ACVP server generated tests.

   *  SP 800-108 - 5 Key Derivation Functions (KDF).  The three
      implementations of KDFs in SP800-108 SHALL be available for
      testing through the ACVP Server.

6.2.2.  KAS-ECC Requirements Not Covered

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 4.3 DLC-based Key-Transport Process.  KeyWrapping
      is not incorporated into ACVP testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.3 Random Number Generation.  Though random values
      are used, the testing of the construction of those random values
      SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.4 Nonces.  Though nonces are used, the testing of
      the construction of those nonces SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP
      testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.5 Domain Parameters.  Domain Parameters SHALL be
      used in the testing of KAS as per the specification, though the
      generation of those parameters is outside the scope of testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6 Key-Pair Generation.  Each KAS scheme from one
      or both parties utilizes a key pair for arriving at a shared
      secret, and deriving a key.  Though a key pair(s) are utilized in
      ACVP testing, the testing of the generation of said key pairs is
      outside the scope of this testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6.2 Required Assurances.  IUT assurance testing
      is outside the scope of ACVP testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.6.2 Key Pair Management.  Testing the IUT's
      management of Key Pairs is outside the scope of ACVP testing.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 5.8.1.2 The ASN.1 Format for FixedInfo.  The ACVP
      server (currently) SHALL NOT support the testing of this format of
      fixed info.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 7 Rationale for Selecting a Specific Scheme.  There
      is no testing associated with the IUT's choice of selecting a
      specific scheme.

   *  SP 800-56Ar3 - 8 Key Recovery.  Key Recovery SHALL NOT be within
      the scope of ACVP testing.

   *  SP 800-56Cr1 - 4 One-Step Key Derivation.  ASN.1 format of
      fixedInfo construction (currently) is NOT supported.

   *  SP 800-56Cr1 - 7 Selecting Hash Functions and MAC Algorithms.  The
      process that goes into the selection of Hash functions and MAC
      algorithms SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing, though the ACVP
      server SHALL support all indicated Hash and MAC functions.

      process that goes into the selection of Hash functions and MAC
      algorithms SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing, though the ACVP
      server SHALL support all indicated Hash and MAC functions.

7.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of KAS ECC algorithms to the
   ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities MUST be advertised as JSON objects within
   the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification [ACVP] for more
   details on the registration message.

7.1.  Prerequisites

   Each algorithm implementation MAY rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, RSA Signature algorithms depend on an
   underlying hash function.  Each of these underlying algorithm
   primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the
   same submission.  ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the
   required prerequisites:

   Prerequisites, if applicable, MUST be submitted in the registration
   as the prereqVals JSON property array inside each element of the
   algorithms array.  Each element in the prereqVals array MUST contain
   the following properties

                      Table 1: Prerequisite Properties

   A "valValue" of "same" SHALL be used to indicate that the
   prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability
   exchange in the same registration.

   An example description of prerequisites within a single algorithm
   capability exchange looks like this

   "prereqVals":
   [
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg1",
       "valValue": "Val-1234"
     },
     {
       "algorithm": "Alg2",
       "valValue": "same"
     }
   ]

7.2.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms

   Some algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, IKEv2 uses an underlying SHA algorithm.
   Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated,
   either separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

7.5.1.1.2.  One Step No Counter KDF Capabilities

   The one step no counter KDF is a special implementation of the one
   step KDF.  This implementation of the KDF does not utilize a 32 bit
   counter as a part of the concatenation that gets fed into function H.
   As such, there is no loop within the KDF due to there being no
   information changing between iterations of the potential
   concatenation, and the KDF output length is capped at the output
   length of the chosen aux function (or 2048 in the case of KMAC).

                       Table 10: Two Step KDF Options

   Note this capabilities object is very similar to the capability
   object from SP800-108.  Specific restrictions inherited from
   SP800-108 include the following.

   *  The 'fixedDataOrder' options "none" and "before iterator" are not
      valid for "counter" KDF.  The 'fixedDataOrder' option "middle
      fixed data" is not valid for "feedback" nor "double pipeline
      iterator" KDF.

   *  A 'counterLength'of 0 describes that there is no counter used.
      The 0 option is not valid for "counter" KDF.

   *  When'counterLength' contains a value of "0", 'fixedDataOrder'must
      contain a value of "none" and vice versus.

7.5.1.3.  FixedInfoPatternConstruction

   IUTs MUST be capable of specifying how the FixedInfo is constructed
   for the KAS/KTS negotiation.  Note that for the purposes of testing
   against the ACVP system, both uPartyInfo and vPartyInfo are REQUIRED
   to be registered within the fixed info pattern.

   Pattern candidates:

   *  literal[0123456789ABCDEF]

      -  uses the specified hex within "[]". literal[0123456789ABCDEF]
         substitutes "0123456789ABCDEF" in place of the field

   *  uPartyInfo

      -  uPartyId { || ephemeralKey } { || ephemeralNonce } { ||
         dkmNonce }

         o  "Optional" items such as ephemeralKey MUST be included when
            available for ACVP testing.

         o  For the purposes of the testing defined in this
            specification, the uPartyInfo value used to create the
            fixedInfo that is input to the key derivation function SHALL
            take the form of "uPartyId { || ephemeralKey } { ||
            ephemeralNonce } { || dkmNonce }".

         o  Whether or not an "optional" item, e.g., ephemeralKey, will
            be included as part of the uPartyInfo for a given test case
            is dependant on the scheme and party being tested.  Please
            consult Section 6 of SP 800-56Ar3 to determine whether or
            not an "optional" item is applicable to the scheme being
            tested and must be included as part of the uPartyInfo for a
            given test case.

         o  uPartyId is the identifier of Party U, i.e., the IDu from
            Sections 5.8 and 6 of SP 800-56Ar3.

   *  vPartyInfo

      -  vPartyId { || ephemeralKey } { || ephemeralNonce } { ||
         dkmNonce }

         o  "Optional" items such as ephemeralKey MUST be included when
            available for ACVP testing.

         o  vPartyId is the identifier of Party V, i.e., the IDv from
            Sections 5.8 and 6 of SP 800-56Ar3.

   *  context

      -  Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the context.

   *  algorithmId

      -  Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the
         algorithmId.

   *  label

      -  Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the label.

   *  l

      -  The length of the derived keying material in bits, MUST be
         represented in 32 bits for ACVP testing.

   Example (Note that party U is the server in this case "434156536964",
   party V is the IUT "a1b2c3d4e5"):

   *  "concatenation" :
      "literal[123456789CAFECAFE]||uPartyInfo||vPartyInfo"

   Evaluated as:

   *  "123456789CAFECAFE434156536964a1b2c3d4e5"

8.  Generation Requirements per Party per Scheme

   The various schemes of KAS all have their own requirements as to keys
   and nonces per scheme, per party.  The below table demonstrates those
   generation requirements, i.e., what values will be provided by the
   server per scheme and party:

9.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation test session would require multiple test
   vector sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each
   test vector set represents an individual cryptographic algorithm
   defined during the capability exchange.  This section describes the
   JSON schema for a test vector set used with SP800-56Ar3 KAS ECC
   algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

    +=============+======================================+===========+
    | JSON Values | Description                          | JSON Type |
    +=============+======================================+===========+

9.1.  Test Groups JSON Schema

   The testGroups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the secure hash JSON elements of the Test
   Group JSON object.

   The test group for KAS/KTS ECC is as follows:

10.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it MUST
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

         Table 29: CDH Component Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

                 Table 30: CDH Component Vector Set Group
                           Response JSON Object

   Each test group contains an array of one or more test cases.  Each
   test case is a JSON object that represents a single test vector to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each DRBG test vector.
